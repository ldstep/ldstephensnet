<p>Apple Notes on iOS 18 now has a new feature called Recent Notes. It lets you quickly jump between the last 10 notes you looked at. This makes it much easier and faster for people with lots of notes, as you don’t need to dig through all your folders.</p>
<p>To access this feature, tap the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the app. You’ll see a Recent Notes option. Tap it to view the last 10 notes you checked out.</p>

<p>What a novel idea: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposes stricter regulations on data brokers, requiring them to adhere to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). This would restrict brokers from selling sensitive data, like Social Security numbers, unless for legitimate purposes (e.g., credit eligibility). The move aims to protect against identity theft and scams, ensuring brokers follow consumer protection laws similar to credit bureaus. It may also reduce the scale of data sales, forcing some brokers out of business. The proposal has broad support despite not addressing data breaches directly.

<p>Whenever I change blogging platforms or domain names or simply post to several places, I feel a twinge of guilt. How will my “audience” feel about the changes? Does it confuse things?[…] I don’t get a lot of traffic, but it’s also not zero traffic, so I feel some responsibility. But why? I am not writing for money or influence or popularity. I write to better understand my thoughts, and sometimes share the result. I write so that I have a record of those things. I write, almost entirely, for me.[…] In that light, I shouldn’t need to worry about whether my RSS feed is consistent or if people need to follow me in too many places. I don’t want to be a dick about it, but c’mon, it’s an unimportant personal blog by some nobody on the internet. Let’s not overthink it.</p>
