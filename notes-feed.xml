            <p>I have the Bear Notes app installed on my MacBook for occasional use. A few weeks ago, I renewed my subscription to test something in the iOS app. However, what I was testing didn’t work, so I requested a refund and received it. I deleted the app from my iPhone and continued to use it occasionally on my MacBook with no syncing.</p>

            <p>A couple of days ago, I received a notification that Bear Web Clipper 2.0 is out, and I wanted to test it on my iPhone, so I reinstalled the app. To my surprise, when I opened it, I found that Pro was enabled and valid through August 26, 2026. The app shows that my subscription is canceled, yet Pro is still enabled. ¯_(ツ)_/</p>
