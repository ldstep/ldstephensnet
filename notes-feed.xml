            <p>This afternoon, while reading the MPU forum, I came across a post discussing menu bar managers. Several posters mentioned that they had stopped using third-party managers and were now using the built-in macOS 26 manager. Intrigued, I decided to give it a try. By being selective and only including items in the menu bar that I actually used, I managed to access everything I needed without any hidden items behind the MacBook Pro notch. I was even able to delete Ice.</p>
