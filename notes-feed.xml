            <p>Lately, I’ve noticed something about how and where I write. When I sit down to write on my MacBook Pro, I often miss keys or lose my place on the keyboard. I chalk that up to having short fingers. Some keys just aren’t comfortable to reach.</p>

			<p>On my 11&quot; iPad with the Magic Keyboard, it’s a different story. I type faster and more accurately, probably because the keyboard is more compact.</p>

			<p>This makes it pretty clear that I should be doing most of my writing on the iPad, and using the MacBook Pro for final editing and processing.</p>

			<p>I wrote this on my M2 iPad Air in Drafts.</p>
