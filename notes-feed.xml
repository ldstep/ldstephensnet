            <![CDATA[
             <p>Today, I completed several projects in preparation for winter. I fired up the Yardmax 35-ton splitter to make sure it’s ready for a workout this week. I also cleaned out the old ash from the burn barrel to prepare it for use. Additionally, I did some cleaning in one of the chicken coops.</p>

            <p>The one big tasks coming up this week is cutting logs from trees that were felled in the spring. I plan to cut the logs into 14-inch pieces, which is the ideal length for our wood burner, and then split them into firewood-sized pieces with the splitter. When all is said and done, I expect to have a cord and a half of firewood.</p>
