            <![CDATA[
            <p>I was thinking this morning that maybe my setup should be Drafts and iA Writer instead of Drafts and Ulysses. I prefer keeping everything in plain text files anyway, not in proprietary databases like Drafts, Ulysses, or Bear. I could just as easily pair Drafts with Devonthink since it already indexes all my folders. And if I need a file-based editor, I’ve got BBEdit, though I already own Devonthink and iA Writer, so iA Writer could fill that role too.</p>

			<p>The other thing that crossed my mind is that Drafts is really a text capture and processing app that can also handle writing. Ulysses and iA Writer are dedicated writing apps.</p>

			<p>At some point I should just make a decision and quit flip-flopping. Wishful thinking ¯_(ツ)_/</p>
