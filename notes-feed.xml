            <p>I’ve been digging into Scott Galloway’s take on healthcare, something he talks about a lot on <a href="https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/pivot">Pivot</a> and honestly, his phased Medicare expansion idea makes a lot of sense for America. He thinks the path to a national system isn’t some overnight revolution. It’s a slow rollout: cut the Medicare age by two years every two years until it covers everyone.</p>

            <p>65 → 63 → 61 → all the way down to zero.</p>

            <p>It’s a simple way to move to a real Medicare for All. Hospitals and insurers get time to adjust. People get coverage without waiting for Congress to agree on the perfect plan.</p>

            <p>I don’t agree with Scott on everything he says, but this one strikes me as both practical and humane. <em>Healthcare as a right</em>, implemented with a plan.</p>
