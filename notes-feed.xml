            <p>Yesterday, while working on a new post for ldstephens, I had a couple of research pieces open. I kept bouncing back and forth between what I was writing and the reference docs, clicking around way more than I wanted to. I&#39;ve been doing it this way for years.</p>

			<p>Frustrated I said to myself, “There has to be a better way to do this.”</p>

			<p>Turns out there is. Tabs. I opened each document in its own tab, and switching between them became effortless. Sometimes the simplest solutions right in front of your nose.</p>
