            <p>It&#8217;s been in the 30s the last few mornings here in central New Jersey. We&#8217;re close to peak fall color. This afternoon I&#8217;m going to mow the grass for what will be the last time until next spring. Of course, I use it along with the leaf blower to clean up all the leaves that are starting to fall.</p>

            <p>2:37:51 PM</p>

            <p>I mowed the entire lawn, and the last thing was the trail that goes around the property. Unfortunately, the transmission belt on my Cub Cadet ZT1 zero-turn mower broke about a quarter mile back in the woods. Shit!</p>

            <p>Now I’ll have to tow it out and get it fixed, as it doesn’t look like a repair I can handle myself.</p>
