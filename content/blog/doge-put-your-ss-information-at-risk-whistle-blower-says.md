Hey friends: This post is about Social Security in the United States, so if you’re not a US reader, you might want to skip it.

[Nicholas Nehamas, New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/us/politics/doge-social-security-data.html)

> Members of the Department of Government Efficiency uploaded a copy of a crucial Social Security database in June to a vulnerable cloud server, putting the personal information of hundreds of millions of Americans at risk of being leaked or hacked, according to a whistle-blower complaint filed by the Social Security Administration’s chief data officer. The database contains records of all Social Security numbers issued by the federal government. It includes individuals’ full names, addresses and birth dates, among other details that could be used to steal their identities, making it one of the nation’s most sensitive repositories of personal information.[…] “Should bad actors gain access to this cloud environment, Americans may be susceptible to widespread identity theft, may lose vital health care and food benefits, and the government may be responsible for reissuing every American a new Social Security number at great cost,” Mr. Borges’s complaint said. He alleged that DOGE did not involve him in discussions about the project, despite his role as chief data officer, leaving him to piece together evidence of what had happened after the fact.[…] A spokesman for the Social Security Administration, Nick Perrine, said that the agency took whistle-blower complaints seriously. “S.S.A. stores all personal data in secure environments that have robust safeguards in place to protect vital information,” he said. “The data referenced in the complaint is stored in a longstanding environment used by S.S.A. and walled off from the internet. High-level career S.S.A. officials have administrative access to this system with oversight by S.S.A.’s information security team.”

The idea that hackers could get their hands on this data is more than a little concerning. And as for trusting the folks at DOGE to keep it safe? Yeah, I’m not sure about that.
