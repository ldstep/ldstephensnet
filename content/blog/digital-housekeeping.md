I did a little digital housekeeping today. On my iPhone and MacBook Pro, I went through my apps and deleted the extras — keeping just one for each task. I also got rid of anything I never use. If I ever miss something, I can always add it back.

Since I do most of my work on my iPhone and MacBook, I’ve turned my iPad into a pure consumption device: reading, watching, and browsing only. No writing apps, no productivity tools, no temptation.

It’s funny how much clearer things feel when you cut out the extras. Each device now has a role, and I feel more focused. Fewer apps, fewer decisions.
