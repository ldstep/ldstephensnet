Brett Terpstra released a nice upgrade to [Marked 2](https://marked2app.com/) yesterday with some improvements for [Bear](https://bear.app/) integration. I purchased my copy of Marked a couple of years ago through the App Store. To preview what I was writing in Bear in Marked was a bit tricky. I always wondered why. In fact, it took me a while to figure out how to do it. Well, [Brett answers](https://brettterpstra.com/2019/04/16/marked-2-dot-5-32-with-extra-bear/) why it was tricky.

> Before I start talking too much about [Bear](https://bear.app/), there’s one issue to note. Bear writes its preview files out to a system temp folder that Marked can’t permanently access from the sandboxed Mac App Store version, so users are constantly asked for permission. If you’re using Bear with the Mac App Store version of Marked, I offer a free crossgrade to the unsandboxed direct version. If you use the **Help->\_Report an Issue\_** feature and just [send me](https://brettterpstra.com/contact/) the top part of the report section (above the `---`), I’ll consider that enough proof to provide you with a license. You can also contact me through the [support forum](http://support.markedapp.com/).

I took Brett up on his offer for the crossgrade to the unsandboxed version Marked. Now viewing what I’m writing in Bear in Marked works as it does in my other apps.

If you’re using the App Store version of Marked I suggest you also take Brett up on his offer. You’ll be glad you did especially if you use Bear.

You’ll want to delete the App Store version of Marked and then install the unsandboxed version.
