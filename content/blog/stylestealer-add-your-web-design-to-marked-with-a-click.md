I use [Marked 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marked-2/id890031187?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude) for preview and proofing my writing. Yesterday Brett Terpstra, the developer of Marked, in a blog post offered a way to add my blogs style sheet to Marked. Now my preview looks almost exactly like it does on my blog. This is cool! Thank you, Brett.
