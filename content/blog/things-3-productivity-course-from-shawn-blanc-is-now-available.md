I’m a [Things 3](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904280696?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude) user. I have the app on both my Macs, iPhone, and iPad. I’ve written about how much I like [here](http://ldstephens.net/2017/10/17/things-3-for-personal-task-management/).

Today Shawn Blanc, the man who runs [The Sweet Setup](https://thesweetsetup.com/), has released his new productivity course [“All the Things”](https://thesweetsetup.com/things/).

**In his own words:**

> Things 3 is the best task management app out there. It is simple and easy to use, and it has a beautiful design. While being powerful enough for even the most detailed and organized power user, it is also simple enough for the rest of us.
> 
> In our new course, All The Things, we will quickly show you how to get up and running with Things 3.
> 
> Moreover, you will get additional, in-depth systems for a more calm approach to productivity and easier task management.
