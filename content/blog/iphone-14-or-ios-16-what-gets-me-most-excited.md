Lee Peterson: Do you look forward to hardware or software?

> I’m more interested in iOS 16 than iPhone 14. Yes, I’m curious to see what gets released and depending on the camera upgrades I might be tempted to get one but for me messing around with iOS and apps in much more interesting.

This is a question worthy of thought in light of [Apple announcing](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/) new iPhones and operating systems today. I’m most looking forward to getting my hands on the improvements to Reminders and Notes.
