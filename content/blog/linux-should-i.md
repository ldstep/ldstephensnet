Linux has been popping up fairly often in my RSS feeds lately. It seems many of the people I follow longtime Mac users among them are suddenly caught up in a wave of Linux enthusiasm, and it's contagious. More than once, I've considered getting a dedicated Linux machine just to play around with.

I'm not a total stranger to Linux; I've used Linux Mint before. But after reading about others' experiences switching, I know better than to go down that rabbit hole again.

The temptation is real because I have both the means and the time, being retired. Usually, those are the ingredients for a fun project.

Switching from Mac to Linux isn't just changing an operating system; it's disrupting a lifestyle. I think about the potential friction: the constant struggle to get my iPhone to interface with a Linux desktop, the clunky web-browser version of iCloud, and the search for software that matches the polish of macOS. On a Mac, things just work.

I don't need another rabbit hole. I'm resisting the urge for now, reminding myself that just because I have the time and the means doesn't mean I should indulge.
