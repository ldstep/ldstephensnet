> Some of my favorite sites on the Internet are not blogs—they are personal websites, wikis or “digital gardens,” places where people share all kinds of interesting content, think out in the open, and maintain notes on topics of obscure (or not-so-obscure) personal interest. Blogs accomplish this same thing to some degree, but blogging is performative in a way that maintaining a personal web site is not. Blogging is typically an act of writing for an audience. As a reader, blogs allow you to get to know the writer through what they choose to say at a podium. Browsing a personal web site, on the other hand, has always felt more like being invited into the writer’s home and getting a glimpse into that person’s inner life through what they display on the walls or their shelves, how they choose their furnishings, what they tend to with great care and what they prefer to neglect, etc.

What Sean wrote in this post made me think about how I see this site.

For a long time, I’ve referred to ldstephens.net as a blog. And yes, I write posts mostly about tech, tools, and how I use them. But my site has always been more than a running list of updates. It has an About page, a Uses page, and a place for notes. It’s where I think out loud and document what matters to me.

So yes, I write posts, but this has helped me see this as more than just a blog. It’s my personal site.
