I change parts of my workflow pretty often. The apps I use for writing and reading RSS rotate the most. 

For writing and journaling, it's Drafts and iA Writer. Drafts has long been my go-to, but lately I've been leaning toward iA Writer. Drafts has too many features I don't use. iA Writer's simplicity works better for me.

For RSS, Reeder Classic is my go-to, though I sometimes switch to NetNewsWire. 

I wish I could just stick with one and be done with it.
