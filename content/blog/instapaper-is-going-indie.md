Instapaper Blog: [Instapaper is going independent](http://blog.instapaper.com/post/175953870856)

> Today, we’re announcing that Pinterest has entered into an agreement to transfer ownership of Instapaper to Instant Paper, Inc., a new company owned and operated by the same people who’ve been working on Instapaper since it was sold to betaworks by Marco Arment in 2013. The ownership transfer will occur after a 21 day waiting period designed to give our users fair notice about the change of control with respect to their personal information.
> 
> We want to emphasize that not much is changing for the Instapaper product outside the new ownership. The product will continue to be built and maintained by the same people who’ve been working on Instapaper for the past five years. We plan to continue offering a robust service that focuses on readers and the reading experience for the foreseeable future.

So, the first thing I’m wondering is if Marco is part of the new company?

This is good news for us loyal Instapaper users. It gives me confidence that one of my most used apps will continue to exist.
