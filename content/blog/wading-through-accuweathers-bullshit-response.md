The other day a security researcher found that AccuWeather’s iOS app sends private location data without user’s permission to a Reveal Mobile a firm that monetizes user location information.

John Gruber has further investigated the story. You can read John’s post here.

> The accusation comes from Will Strafach, a respected security researcher who discovered the “actual information” by observing network traffic. He saw the AccuWeather iOS app sending his router’s name and MAC address to Reveal Mobile. This isn’t speculation. They were caught red-handed — [go ahead and read Strafach’s original report](https://medium.com/@chronic_9612/advisory-accuweather-ios-app-sends-location-information-to-data-monetization-firm-83327c6a4870).

I use the default iOS weather app so I’m sure it’s not doing the same thing. If you’re using AccuWeather delete it now.
