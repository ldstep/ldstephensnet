Over the last few months, I’ve put on a few extra pounds. I’m not happy about that so last Wednesday I decided to do something about it.

Back in the day when I was racing bicycles competitively I always paid very close attention to my weight so that I would be at my optimum race weight. So to get my weight under control now I’m going to use the same strategy that I used when I was racing.

Weight management is calories in and calories out. Eat more calories than you burn and you gain weight. Burn more calories than you eat and you lose weight.

I only want to lose 5 pounds. You might say that’s hardly worth worrying about. For most people that might be true. But for me that 5 pounds makes a difference in how my clothes fit and hence how I feel.

To get started I calculated my [BMR](https://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator) (Basal Metabolic Rate) and [RDI](https://www.fatsecret.com/Default.aspx?pa=rdic) (Recommended Daily Intake) so that I have my baseline calorie requirements. To manage my calorie intake I’m using the iOS app [Fat Secret](https://www.fatsecret.com) and for calorie burn, I’m using the Apple Watch and the Activity app.

I’ve lost 2 pounds so far so I know my strategy is working.
