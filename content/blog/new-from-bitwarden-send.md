## Secure one-to-one information sharing

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) has been my password manager since [1Password](https://1password.com/) went subscription a few years ago. Don’t get me wrong I love 1Password but by comparison, it’s pricey. Bitwarden is free to use with Premium features for $10 a year. The free version will do everything most people need from a password manager.

This week Bitwarden introduced a cool new feature. [Send for secure one-to-one information sharing](https://bitwarden.com/blog/post/introducing-bitwarden-send-for-secure-sharing/). “Bitwarden Send is a lightweight utility used to share information with another person for a limited period of time. Bitwarden users can easily transmit a file or text, and rest easy knowing the sent information is protected with end-to-end encryption, and will not live forever. Users choose an expiration date for the Send link, after which it no longer works to access the information.”

“This new feature is available on all Bitwarden clients: Web Vault, mobile, browser extensions, and CLI, meaning users will always have a secure way to share sensitive information temporarily.”

This isn’t something that I will use all that often but it sure is good to know that Send is there for that rare occasion that I need it.
