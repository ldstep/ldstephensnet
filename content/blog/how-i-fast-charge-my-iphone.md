Here’s a trick I learned a while back.

There are times I want to fast charge my iPhone. By the way, I’m still using my iPhone 7 Plus. [The 5W charger](https://aos.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l7vG/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMD810LL%2FA%2Fapple-5w-usb-power-adapter) that comes with most iPhones is not able to fast charge and it’s also not able to charge other devices like my iPad.

Now, here’s the trick. Most iPads come with a [12W charging block](https://aos.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l7vG/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMD836LL%2FA%2Fapple-12w-usb-power-adapter). So to speed up charging on my iPhone I use my iPad charging block. [According to Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202105) charging your iPhone with the iPad charger block won’t harm your iPhone.

Next time you want to speed up the charging time on your iPhone give this a try.
