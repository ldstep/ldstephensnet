> Because I've elected to eschew all of these platforms, I find myself in a position in which discovery can (and often is) problematic and curation is of paramount importance. It's a slow moving process of following blogs, following blogs and authors they link to and doing the same with news services. It's an approach to the internet that's both slower and freer. I can finish scrolling what I follow because none of it's designed to keep me engaged in perpetuity.

Well put, Cory. It takes time and effort to build a good set of personal blogs to follow, ones you actually enjoy reading. Every day, as I go through my reading list, I check out any blogs people link to. That's exactly how I found Cory's blog.
