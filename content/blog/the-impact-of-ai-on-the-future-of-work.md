If you‚Äôve been thinking about what AI might mean for your job or your future it‚Äôs definitely worth listening to this week‚Äôs episode of _On with Kara Swisher_.

Kara talks with futurist [Martin Ford](https://mfordfuture.com/](https://mfordfuture.com/)) (author of _Rise of the Robots_) and economist [Betsey Stevenson](https://fordschool.umich.edu/faculty/betsey-stevenson](https://fordschool.umich.edu/faculty/betsey-stevenson)) from the University of Michigan. They dig into one of the biggest questions out there: will AI create jobs or eliminate them?

They discuss which types of work are most at risk, where new opportunities might arise, and how long this shift could take. They also explore how government might help people adapt and consider ideas like universal basic income and a ‚Äúdigital dividend.‚Äù

If you‚Äôre early in your career or just trying to figure out how to stay ahead of all this, it‚Äôs a smart, grounded listen that will give you plenty to think about.
