On November 11 [Instapaper announced that a Mac app](https://blog.instapaper.com/post/634511169876557824) is available in the [Mac App Store](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Finstapaper%2Fid288545208&t=M2VlMTFhMGQ5ZGRmYWNmMmEzODUwNjA1MzdmNjkxMjE5M2MyNzY5NSxYM3FGMWZ0UQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AOZjQZ-Pa6uMEdOyfetS5_g&p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.instapaper.com%2Fpost%2F634511169876557824&m=1&ts=1606234065), thanks to Apple’s Catalyst technology. As a long-time Instapaper user, I was excited to hear this. Now that I’ve used the app for a few days it’s nothing more than a basic reader and lacks almost all the features the website and iOS apps have.

You can’t highlight text, add notes, copy text, copy article links, delete articles from the article view, and the share sheet is non-functional.

The app in its current state is useless to me. Let’s hope the developer gets the app on par with the iOS apps and website.
