If you’re not familiar with Alfred, [Alfred 3 for Mac](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is an award-winning app for which boosts your efficiency with hotkeys, keywords, text expansion and more.

[Recents is an Alfred workflow](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/713-recent-items-42-for-alfred-3-docs-folders-apps-custom-categories-favorites-interaction-with-opensave-dialogs-and-more/) triggered by the rec keyword. This opens up the navigation menu shown in the screenshot below where I can select a category to narrow down my search of recent items. The available options are Now (for the most recently accessed files), Folders, Applications, Documents, Downloads, and Favorites.

I use this instead of using Finder or the Recent Items menu to find recently used files, folders, documents, applications etc. I find this much quicker as all my recent items are in one place.
