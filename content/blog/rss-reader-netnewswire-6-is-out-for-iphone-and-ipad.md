“[NetNewsWire 6 for iOS](https://nnw.ranchero.com) is now available on the App Store! This release brings new features — iCloud sync; sync with BazQux, Inoreader, NewsBlur, The Old Reader, and FreshRSS; home screen widgets; special support for Twitter and Reddit feeds; and more.”

If you’re not using RSS now is a perfect time to give it a try. [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) is free and with version 6, you can now use iCloud for syncing, saving the cost of a paid syncing service.
