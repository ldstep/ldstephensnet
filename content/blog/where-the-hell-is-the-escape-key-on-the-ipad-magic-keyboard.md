## Change the behavior of the modifier keys on iPad

If, like me, you rarely use the caps lock key, you might be interested to learn that you can remap it on a [hardware keyboard in iPadOS](https://www.apple.com/ipad-keyboards/). I mapped mine to Escape.

**How to Remap Modifier Keys on iPad When Using a Keyboard**

-   Launch the Settings app on your ‌iPad‌
-   Select General -> Keyboard
-   Select Hardware Keyboard
-   Select Modifier Keys
-   Select the key that you’d like to modify …
-   Select the action that you’d like to perform when tapping the chosen key

That’s it.
