One issue I ran into on my MacBook Pro is that Hidden Bar doesn’t play well with the notch, so I had to find a different menu bar manager. After looking around, I settled on [Ice](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice) by Jordan Baird. What I like about Ice is that it puts extra menu bar items in a secondary bar below the main one.

I’m not sure if this will work with macOS Tahoe yet, but there’s already a beta: [Ice 0.11.13 (macOS Tahoe Beta 1)](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/releases/tag/0.11.13-dev.1).
