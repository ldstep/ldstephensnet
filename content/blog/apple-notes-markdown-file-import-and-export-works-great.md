> In iOS 26, currently in beta, Apple Notes has gained new Markdown support, letting you seamlessly import and export files in the popular plain-text formatting language. Whether you're a developer, writer, or content creator, this long-awaited feature should bridge the gap between your existing Markdown workflow and Apple's native note-taking app.

I wasn't sure how well this would work, but I wanted to find out. So, since I have iPadOS 26 beta on my iPad, I have been experimenting with the markdown import and export features. In my testing, it works great. On the iPad, you can bulk import markdown files by going to File > Import Notes and then selecting the files you want to import. I have been maintaining my notes as markdown files, but today I bulk imported them into Notes, knowing that I can also export them back out as markdown files if needed.
