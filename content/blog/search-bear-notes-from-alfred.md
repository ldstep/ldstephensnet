If you’re using [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and [Bear](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear-beautiful-writing-app/id1091189122?mt=12&at=1000lude) I want to share a workflow with you that I use to search Bear notes or tags and open the result from Alfred.

Here’s how it works.

**Searching and opening results**

-   **bs** — Search for a note by title and open it in Bear.
-   **bst** — Search for a tag (a group of notes) by tag title and open it in Bear.

You can also create a new note from Alfred.

**Creating a new note**

-   **bn** — Create a new note with input as title. Tags optional.
    -   **bn I love notes!** — Creates a new note with the title and text “I love notes!”
    -   **bn I love notes! #love #notes** — Creates a new note with the title and text “I love notes!” and the tags “#love” and “#notes”

This saves some keystrokes if I’m not already working in Bear.
