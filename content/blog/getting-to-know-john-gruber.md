John Gruber is one of the leading experts blogging and podcasting about Apple. Recode referred to him this way “**[Apple obsessive John Gruber built Daring Fireball, the world’s most powerful one-man media company](https://www.vox.com/2016/6/30/12053348/john-gruber-daring-fireball-apple-podcast-recode-media)**” If you’re into Apple you know who he is. John blogs at [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net) and has a podcast [The Talk Show](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/). He’s also the creator of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) the popular plain text writing markup language that many of us use today.

I’m an enthusiastic follower of John’s blog and listener of his podcast. I find him to be knowledgeable about all things Apple thanks to his contacts at the highest levels of the company. What he writes is well written, always informative, and accurate.

I find it interesting to know what makes people like John tick and how they got to where they are. I’ve heard John talk about himself on his podcast but only bits and pieces never the full story from beginning to where he is now.

The other day John posted about being on Antony Johnston’s Writing and Breathing Podcast. If you would like to hear John’s full store in his words listen to this podcast. It’s excellent!

> Antony Johnston — best known as the creator of the excellent and right-up-my-alley Atomic Blonde  — hosts a podcast devoted to writing, and he was kind enough to invite me on. I could talk about writing — what I do, how I do it — forever, even though, as I hope I made clear to Johnston, I don’t really fully understand how exactly I do what I do. The only thing I _really_ understand about writing is that I need to do it.
