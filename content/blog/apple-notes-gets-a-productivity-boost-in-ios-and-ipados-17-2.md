Hey friends, Apple Notes is one of the best note-taking apps for iPhone and iPad, with features like nested folders and tags for organization, support for rich-text formatting, Apple Pencil support on iPad, a built-in document scanner, and more. With the iOS 17 update, the Notes app has received several new features you will love but there are four that I’m really looking forward to using:

-  **Notes Linking:** This will help me keep my notes organized and interconnected.
-  **PDF Editing:** Annotating and marking up PDFs right in my notes is a game-changer. I’ll no longer need a third-party app.
-  **Undo/Redo Buttons:** Making corrections will now be a breeze. No more three-finger swipe.
-  **Block Quotes:** Perfect for emphasizing important text or citing sources.

For an in depth review of all the new features, I recommend watching Christopher Lawley’s [How I Use Apple Notes: iPad Productivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VHfHX2xJcM) YouTube video.
