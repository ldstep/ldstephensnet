The other day I wrote that I have [been testing Brave](https://ldstephens.net/2019/09/02/brave-browser/) on my Mac as my primary browser. So I’m in the process of setting everything up the way I want it. One issue I was having was [Shield](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022973471-What-is-Shields-) changes that I made on individual sites weren’t being remembered after quitting and restarting Brave. I tried finding an answer to this issue with a google search but with no luck.

So I did a little tinkering around and here’s how I fixed it.

Go to **Settings > Additional settings > Privacy and security > Clear browsing data** and make sure **Site settings** is unchecked in the **Advanced** and **On exit** tabs.
