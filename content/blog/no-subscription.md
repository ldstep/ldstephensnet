My [Ulysses](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225570693?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude) free use period is up in a few days. I’m writing this to convince myself that I don’t need a Ulysses subscription.

I like writing in Ulysses. I also like writing in my other writing apps at times. If I’m paying a subscription I would feel compelled to always use that app. So, I think the best option for me is to use the paid version of Ulysses that I already own. My paid version works with Sierra and High Sierra. Of course, there’s no guarantee it’ll work in future versions of macOS or iOS but I’ll deal with that if or when the time comes. I’ve also determined that I can do almost everything in my other writing apps that I can do in Ulysses should it go away. The methodology is just different.

Here’s a list of writing apps that I **own** and enjoy using:

-   Ulysses (paid version still works with Sierra and High Sierra)
-   [MultiMarkdown Composer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/multimarkdown-composer-4/id1275176220?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude)
-   [Byword](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude)
-   [iA Writer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id775737590?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude)
-   [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html)
-   [Bear](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear-beautiful-writing-app/id1091189122?mt=12&at=1000lude)
