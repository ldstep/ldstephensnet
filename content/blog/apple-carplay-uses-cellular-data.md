We’ve been on a Verizon plan with only 2 GB of data for years and have only occasionally run out of data. Recently, we have been burning through it in just a few days. What changed?

We bought a new Jeep Wrangler that has CarPlay. [According to this article by Jason Cross at MacWorld,](https://www.macworld.com/article/233855/carplay-faq.html) “CarPlay itself doesn’t cost you anything. When you’re using it to navigate, message, or listen to music, podcasts, or audio books, you might use data from your phone’s data plan. Depending on your cellular data limits, that may end up costing you.”

We’ve upgraded our Verizon data plan and yes, it cost us more money.
