As a long-time Drafts user, I’m experimenting with a new approach to capturing content.

Most of my capture happens on my iPhone. Traditionally, I’ve used Drafts to gather everything, then send it to its final destination. I’m considering bypassing Drafts and capturing content directly into its final app.

Here’s the plan:

-   **Blogging/Writing:** Capture in [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)
-   **Notes:** Capture in Apple Notes
-   **Reminders and Tasks:** Capture in [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/)

This method covers most of what I capture.

I’ve created a shortcut called Quick Add on my iPhone for quick capture to Things, Notes, and iA Writer to streamline the process. The Quick Add shortcut, in my Dock, allows me to quickly add a new task to Things, a new note to Notes, or a new idea for a blog post to iA Writer. I’ll let you know how this works out for me.
