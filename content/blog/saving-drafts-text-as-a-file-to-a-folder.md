[Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) is my favorite place to capture ideas. But once something’s captured, I usually want to do something with it like send it to a specific folder where it belongs.  

That’s where [Bookmarks](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/settings/bookmarks) come in. Bookmarks let you grant Drafts permission to access specific folders on your Mac or iOS device. Once a folder is bookmarked, you can use Drafts actions—the “File” step or scripting—to send text straight into that folder, no extra tapping around in the Files app.  

For example, I keep a folder in iCloud Drive called *Ideas*. Anytime I jot something down in Drafts that I want to save there, I just run my action and Drafts puts a markdown file right into that folder. Quick, clean, and no copy-paste needed.  

If you haven’t tried bookmarks, they’re worth a look. They open up a lot of possibilities for using Drafts with folders and files.
