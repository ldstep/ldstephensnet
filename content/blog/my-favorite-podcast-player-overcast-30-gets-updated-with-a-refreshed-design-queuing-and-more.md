[Overcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lude), my favorite podcast player has been upgraded to version 3.0 with a new design.

The new design took a couple of minutes to digest but Marco’s blog post will walk you through all the changes. Like me, you will probably catch on quickly.

If you’re using the free version of the app you’ll be happy to see that Marco has changed his advertising model and that the new ads are much nicer. I hardly even noticed that they were there.

Marco Arment, [Blog Post writing about Overcast 3.0](https://marco.org/2017/02/20/overcast3)

> Overcast 3 is now available, and it’s a huge update, mostly in the design and flow of the interface. I’ve been working on it since last summer, informed by over two years of testing, usage, and customer feedback.

> I designed Overcast 1.0 in 2014 for iOS 7, and it was a product of its time: it used ultra-thin text and lines against stark, sharp-edged, full-screen white sheets and translucent blur panes, with much of the basic functionality behind hidden gestures. That fundamental design carried through every update until today.
