I read a lot of reviews when Apple releases their new OS’s. That way I’m up to speed on what to expect when I finally decide to install them.

MacStories reviews are always one of the best.

**No stone is left unturned in iOS 13 – and that includes iPad too.

**[macOS Catalina: The MacStories Review](https://www.macstories.net/news/macos-catalina-the-macstories-review/)  
**With Catalina, Apple has taken clear, though not always successful, steps to bridge the divide between the Mac and iOS. App functionality has been realigned, System Preferences has been rearranged, and new features have been added to make it easier to move from one platform to the other.
