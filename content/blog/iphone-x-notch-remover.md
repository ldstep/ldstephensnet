I haven’t purchased the iPhone 10. Yet? I have read and listened to a lot of reviews on it though. One of the most controversial things about it is the notch at the top of the screen. Some people hate it, others are okay with it and some tolerate it.

Here’s a way to get rid of it. In the App Store, today there’s a new app [Notch Remover](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notch-remover/id1277467873?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lude). Notch Remover lets you remove the notch from the status bar. It modifies your wallpaper to adjust for the notch. You can check out some of the amazing results in the [screenshots on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notch-remover/id1277467873?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lude).

I’ve also heard that using the black wallpaper that’s part of iOS 11 does a pretty good job of disguising it.
