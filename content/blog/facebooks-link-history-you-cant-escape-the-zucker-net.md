Facebook’s [Link History](https://gizmodo.com/meet-link-history-facebook-s-new-way-to-track-the-we-1851134018) is a relatively new feature that’s on by default and is causing quite a stir. It’s an optional setting on the Facebook mobile app (Android and iOS) that lets you see a list of websites you’ve visited within the Facebook app’s built-in browser, for the past 30 days. While it might seem convenient for remembering past browsing, there are some things you should know about it:

**What it does:**

- Tracks links you click inside the Facebook app and visit in their in-app browser.
- Stores the data for 30 days, then automatically deletes it.
- Lets you view, delete individual links, or clear the entire history.

**Privacy concerns:**

- Data collection: Facebook uses this information to improve ad targeting across their platforms (including Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.).
- Lack of transparency: It’s not entirely clear how they use this data beyond ads, and their privacy policy isn’t very specific.
- Potential for misuse: This data could be used for other purposes, like building detailed profiles of your interests and activities.

**How to control it:**

- You can choose to turn Link History on or off in your Facebook app settings.
- You can also clear your Link History at any time.

I hope this information helps you decide whether or not to use Link History.
