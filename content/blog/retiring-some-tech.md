I’m experimenting with retiring some of the tech that I’m using.

Our New Jersey house is smaller than the house we were living in in California. With the smaller space, I’ve come to the realization that I no longer need two Macs. All I need is my MacBook Pro and iPad. My iMac is 5 years old. It is stuck on Sierra so when Mojave releases it will be two OS’s behind. I wrote about the problems I had attempting to upgrade it to High Sierra [here](http://ldstephens.net/2017/10/01/problems-upgrading-to-high-sierra/).

I also have a very old and ugly giant laser printer that I removed from my desk yesterday. The only reason I was keeping it on my desk was for scanning. I don’t do that much scanning anymore and I can use Scanner Pro on my iPhone or iPad in its place. If I need to print something, which I don’t do that often since going paperless, I can print to our wifi printer.

For now, my iMac is still on my desk. When I’ve determined that I no longer need it it will join my old printer in the closet. I’d sell it but it’s not worth much.
