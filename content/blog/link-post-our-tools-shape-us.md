> Yes, _"Writing is thinking_,"[…] It's the _writing_ where the creative act occurs, the _thinking_.[…] If you want to get the most from your practice, first, _have a practice_. Then, stick with one tool. Find one that that appeals to you, doesn't get in your way, and _use it_.[…] If you want something that's _yours_, that's _meaningful to you_, then build a relationship with a tool that serves you, and remain faithful to it. If you outgrow it someday, you'll know. And you'll know what to do.

Some good advice on the tools that we use.
