I’ve been using nvALT for notes since I started using a Mac. Yes, I’ve tried other options but have always ended up coming back to nvALT. I’ve [written a few posts about nvALT](https://ldstephens.net/?s=nvalt) on this blog in the past.

Today [Brett posted](http://brettterpstra.com/2017/09/19/nvalt-2-dot-2-8-because-i-got-high-sierra/) that he had been having problems getting nvALT to work with High Sierra but had finally gotten it fixed and released a new version 2.2.8.

> Here’s to nvALT’s survival until BitWriter gets back on track!

I’m wondering if it isn’t time to make a permanent move to [Bear](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear-beautiful-writing-app/id1091189122?mt=12&at=1000lude) which I’ve used, for short periods, in the past? Or at least until Brett gets BitWriter finished.
