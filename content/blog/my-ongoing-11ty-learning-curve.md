Hey friends, Iâ€™m still learning how to use 11ty, and every now and then something clicks.

I've come to the realization that I don't need to write blog posts in a code editor like VS Code. If I'm just writing a post, a regular text editor does the job just fine.

All I need to do is drop the Markdown file into the posts folder of my local 11ty project. That folder is part of my local Git repository. Once the file's there, GitHub Desktop picks up the change. From there, I can commit and push it, and Netlify takes care of the rest building and publishing the updated to my site.

The only time I need a code editor is when I want to make a change to the site itself, like tweaking the layout, updating styles, or editing config files.
