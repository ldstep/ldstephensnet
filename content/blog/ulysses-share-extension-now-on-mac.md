A feature that has been missing in [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) on the Mac has been a share extension. Since I do my research, information gathering and writing on a Mac this involved a lot of copy and paste. This would always be a sore spot for me and I would think to myself why can’t Ulysses have a Mac share extension like [Bear](https://bear.app/). Well, no more complaining because Ulysses version 14.2 for Mac included a share extension. Thanks to the share extension I can now send text, links, and images directly to Ulysses.

If your not familiar with the share extension here’s a [Ulysses share extension tutorial](https://ulysses.app/tutorials/share-extension).
