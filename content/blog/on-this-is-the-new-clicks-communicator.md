> And let me be clear up front - BlackBerry fans past and present are absolutely going to LOVE Communicator. But this isn't just for them. I think it's going to open a lot of eyes for people who've never experienced what a real keyboard on a phone can do.

This [thing](https://www.clicksphone.com/communicator) looks fucking cool. I used a BlackBerry for several years and loved it. Typing on that keyboard with my thumbs was fantastic. As touchscreen phones became popular, I eventually switched to an Android and then to an iPhone around 2014. I'm tempted to get one, but we'll see.
