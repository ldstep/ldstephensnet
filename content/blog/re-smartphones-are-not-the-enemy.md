I often ask myself, am I addicted to my iPhone? I use it a lot—every single day.  

But let’s be honest, it probably shouldn’t even be called a phone. It’s a small computer that happens to make calls, one I carry in my pocket every single day. And truth be told, I’d rather send a message than talk on the phone anyway.  

I don’t think smartphones are addictive. The apps are. What I’m not addicted to is social media, I don’t fucking participate in any of it. Maybe that’s an age thing. For me, the smartphone is just a tool, one that makes a lot of things in life easier.  

Smartphones aren’t the enemy. How we use them is.
