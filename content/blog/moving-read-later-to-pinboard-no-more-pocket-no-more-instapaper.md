I’ve used read later services since around 2012. In the past, I’ve kept my bookmarks in Pocket, Instapaper, Evernote, Notes, Bear, and sometimes a combination of the above. I was never happy with any one system until I moved all my bookmarks to [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in).

I’m a recent convert to Pinboard. My move to Pinboard was influenced by [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com/), the developer of nvALT and Marked, and [Gabe Weatherhead of MacDrifter](http://www.macdrifter.com/). They spoke so highly of Pinboard that I wanted to give it a go. I went all in with the archiving account.

Since I moved all my bookmarks to Pinboard I started to wonder if I still needed Instapaper? The answer. No.

I now save all my read later to Pinboard. There is a healthy ecosystem of apps around the Pinboard service, as a read later solutions. I use [Readkit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/readkit/id588726889?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude) on my Mac and [Pinner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinner-for-pinboard/id591613202?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lude) on my iPhone for managing my bookmarks and reading later. After reading an article I delete it or if I want to keep it I mark it read and add the appropriate tag(s).
