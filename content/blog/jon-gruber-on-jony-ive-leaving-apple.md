If you’re into this type of thing, John Gruber’s take on Jony Ive, Apple’s longtime design guru, leaving Apple is a good read. Gruber is the designer and inventor of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). He also writes [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/), an Apple-focused blog and hosts a related podcast [The Talk Show](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/).

> I don’t worry that Apple is in trouble because Jony Ive is leaving; I worry that Apple is in trouble because he’s not being replaced.
