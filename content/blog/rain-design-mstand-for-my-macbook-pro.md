If you’re a regular reader of this blog you’ll know that I recently sold my old iMac to [Sell Your Mac](https://www.sellyourmac.com/) and am now using my 2015 MacBook Pro (MBP) as my primary computer.

To make my MBP more like a desktop computer, while working at my desk, I purchased the [Rain Design mStand](https://www.raindesigninc.com/mstand.html). It raises the screen height to eye level and the tilt design brings the screen closer and improves airflow around my MBP. The cable organizer behind routes my wires neatly. It’s sand-blasted and silver anodized finish matches my MBP perfectly.

I also kept my Magic Keyboard, Mouse, and Trackpad 2.

And as a side note, [Wirecutter](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-laptop-stands/) rated the mStand the best budget laptop stand of 2019.
