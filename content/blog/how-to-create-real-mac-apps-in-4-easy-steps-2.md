Instapaper is my favorite read it later app. One thing that has always bothered me is Instapaper not having a Mac desktop app. I do a fair amount of reading on my MacBook Pro so I had to either read my Instapaper stories on the Instapaper website or in Readkit neither of which was the optimal reading environment for me.

I was searching google for a particular Mac app the other day and I ran across a forum where someone mentioned using Fluid to create Mac desktop apps. I went to the [Fluid website](http://fluidapp.com) to check it out. Fluid lets you create a Real Mac App (or “Fluid App”) out of any website or web application, effectively turning your favorite web apps into Mac desktop apps. I read several reviews to be sure Fluid was safe to install on my Mac. I always trust the reviews of [Federico Viticci at Mac Stories](https://www.macstories.net/author/viticci/). His article [30 Web Apps You Should Turn into Mac Apps with Fluid:](https://www.macstories.net/roundups/30-web-apps-you-should-turn-into-mac-apps-with-fluid/) convinced me to give Fluid a try.

Creating a Fluid App out of your favorite website is simple.

1.  Download the Fluid app
2.  Launch the Fluid app
3.  Enter the website’s URL, provide a name, and optionally choose an icon.
4.  Click “Create”, and within seconds your chosen website has a permanent home on your Mac as a real Mac application that appears in your Dock.

I now have my Instapaper desktop app plus a few others.

Since I no longer needed Readkit to read my Instapaper articles on my MacBook I was able to switch to [Reeder](http://reederapp.com) as my RSS client for Mac and iOS. If you would like to learn more about Reeder I recommend reading this article by Stephen Hackett [”Reeder is the best RSS client for Mac OS X users. It syncs with lots of third-party services, looks good, and makes it easy to share content with others”.](http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-rss-reader-os-x/)

[Fluid is free](http://fluidapp.com). You can download Fluid for free and create as many Fluid Apps as you like. However, for $4.99, you can purchase a Fluid License which unlocks a few extra features.
