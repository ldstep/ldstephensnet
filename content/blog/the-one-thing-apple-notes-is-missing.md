[Quick note and tags](https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/19/ios-15-notes-app-iphone/) are coming to [Apple Notes](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205773) in iPadOS 15. Even though these are nice additions, I doubt that Notes will become my everyday note-taking app, and here’s why.

Many of the notes that I take throughout the day are notes that I will want to do something with later. A note may become a task in [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/), a reminder, or event in [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical), a new draft for this blog in [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/), or a journal entry in [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/). Missing from Notes is the lack of export options or actions to get notes out of Notes. This is a dealbreaker for making Notes my everyday note’s app. That’s why I use [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/). Ya know, the old saying “text starts here”. Any text starts in Drafts, including stuff that may eventually end up in Notes.

That said, I do use Notes as cold storage for notes that I seldom reference. I have several hundred of these notes and Notes is the perfect place for them.
