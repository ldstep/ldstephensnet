I stopped using [1Password in July 2019 when it stopped working with Safari 13 in macOS Catalina](https://ldstephens.net/2019/07/07/safari-13-will-no-longer-work-for-customers-using-1password-6/). At that time, I tried Enpass but eventually settled on [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) which I’ve been happily using since. I went Premium about a year ago.

Even though I switched to Bitwarden, I didn’t delete 1Password from my devices, thinking that if Bitwarden didn’t work out that I might want to switch back. I never found a reason to switch back, and I’m glad I didn’t because now with [1Password 8 standalone vaults will no longer be supported](https://1password.community/discussion/123951/last-versions-for-standalone-non-account-vaults).

Since standalone vaults are no longer supported with 1Password 8 I didn’t see any reason to keep it installed on my Mac, iPhone, and iPad. If you’re searching for an alternative, I can highly recommend Bitwarden.
