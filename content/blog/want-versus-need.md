I started this post the other day and never got around to publishing it. So I never got around to hitting “Buy Now.”

I can be pretty frugal with my money. I have no problem spending on things we need, like the new washer and dryer we just had to buy. But when it comes to things I _want_ but don't _need_, I have a hard time convincing myself to spend the money.

Take the new base model M4 MacBook Pro. I'd love to get one, but I just haven’t been able to bring myself to pull the trigger. I don't know why I can afford it. I have the money. Life's short, and I won’t be taking my money with me. I _should_ spend some of it on things that bring me joy.

Consider this my official justification for hitting "Buy Now."

Today I read this on MacRumors: [Apple's Upcoming Macs Listed in New Report](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/03/future-mac-identifiers/)

> Apple is expected to release new MacBook Pro models with M5, M5 Pro, and M5 Max chips later this year. Just like [in 2024](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announcements-m4-imac-mac-mini-macbook-pro/), the report suggests that updated Mac mini and iMac models with M5 chips could launch at the same time.

I’m glad I procrastinated. Now, I’ll be waiting for the M5 MacBook Pro to arrive later this year.
