> The Wall Street Journal[ran an article](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-ai-news-publishers-7e687141)covering how News Sites are seeing a dramatic decrease in traffic in response to Google’s new AI tools. This shouldn’t be a surprise. AI search delivers answers without requiring the you to click on the blue links. So there’s less traffic for all Internet sources and, subsequently, less revenue.

This is so true. Just today, I wanted a list of all the auto races on TV. Instead of checking the TV guide or googling it, I asked Perplexity to list the races, with times and channels. It gave me a full rundown in seconds. Why would I do it any other way?
