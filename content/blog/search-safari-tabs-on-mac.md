Have you ever had a bunch tabs open in Safari and wanted to go to one particular tab? It’s a pain to cycle through all the open tabs to find the one you’re looking for.

Here’s a way to search open Safari tabs thanks to a [post by Gabe Weatherhead (Macdrifter)](http://www.macdrifter.com/2017/12/safari-tab-search-on-the-mac.html) this morning.

> Here’s a little Safari trick that is just gold. Hit Shift-⌘-\\ to enter the Safari “Show all tabs” mode. From there it’s just a simple ⌘-F to search the open tabs.

I tried this out and it worked perfectly. I often have several tabs open at the same time so I’ll be using this trick often. Thanks Gabe.
