I didn’t start this blog in 2016 with any big plan. I just wanted a place to share how I use my tech: apps, workflows, devices, the setups that make things click for me. Write a post, hit publish, move on to the next thing.

Sometimes I’m figuring things out as I go. Sometimes I’m just documenting what works or doesn’t work. Either way, the goal’s always been the same: share what I’ve learned in case it helps someone else or future me.

If you’ve read any of these 500 posts, thanks. I’m glad you’re here.
