[TunnelBear](https://www.tunnelbear.com/) has been my VPN service of choice for just over a year. I was excited to read that TunnelBear has undergone a public security audit by Germany-based penetration testing company [Cure53](https://cure53.de/). This gives confidence I’ve chosen the right VPN provider and that TunnelBear isn’t scraping and selling my browsing data.

[TunnelBear Blog, 07 August 2017](https://www.tunnelbear.com/blog/tunnelbear_public_security_audit/)

> Consumers and experts alike have good reason to question the security claims of the VPN industry. Over the last few years, many less reputable VPN companies have abused users’ trust by selling their bandwidth, their browsing data, offering poor security or even embedding malware.

> Being within the industry, it’s been hard to watch. We knew TunnelBear was doing the right things. We were diligent about security. We deeply respected our users’ privacy. While we can’t restore trust in the industry, we realized we could go further in demonstrating to our customers why they can, and should, have trust in TunnelBear.​

> Today, we’d like to announce TunnelBear has completed the Consumer VPN industry’s first 3rd party, public security audit. Our auditor, Cure53, has published their findings on their website and we’re content with the results.

> However, the recent crisis of trust in the VPN industry showed us we needed to break the silence and share Cure53’s findings publicly. Today we’re sharing a complete public audit which contains both the results from last year and the results from the current audit.

You can read the [full report](https://cure53.de/summary-report_tunnelbear.pdf) on Cure53’s website.
