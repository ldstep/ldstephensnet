I have been super critical of Instapaper lately. [I wrote on Medium](https://ldstephens.me/instapaper-has-gone-to-shit-8a9afa8db461) about how over the past year it has gone to shit. Not only that but I along with others thought that it was abandoned which prompted me to [write an Open Letter](https://ldstephens.net/2022/01/01/open-letter-to-the-developers-of-instapaper/) to the developer asking them to fix or sell the app. Then a few days ago [I wrote](https://ldstephens.net/2022/01/18/what-ill-use-in-place-of-instapaper/) about the app that I was going to use in place of Instapaper.

Yesterday, Instapaper was brought back from the dead with version 8.1. I immediately subscribed to Premium again.
