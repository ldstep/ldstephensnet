Every year towards the end of December I evaluate the apps that I’ve been using and what I will use for the next year. I find that writing this out helps me better evaluate the apps that best fit my workflows. Once I complete my evaluation, I summarize it in a post on this blog.

Another reason for this post is that visitors are always asking me which apps I use for specific tasks. To keep from repeating myself over and over, here’s the list of apps that I use.

## My setup:

-   MacBook Pro early–2015 13” (soon to be replaced with a MacBook Air M1/8gb)
-   iPhone 11
-   iPad 5th Generation (which I rarely use these days)
-   Apple Watch 44 mm Series 4

            -   [Utilities / Productivity](#utilities-productivity)

#### Web

Safari – Safari is my browser of choice. I use [Wipr](https://giorgiocalderolla.com/wipr.html) with Safari to block ads, trackers, cryptocurrency miners, and other annoyances.

As we all know some websites don’t play nice with Safari. In those situations I use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/).

#### Communication

[Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=14726057) – I’ve been using Fastmail for email ever since [I left Gmail](https://ldstephens.medium.com/two-years-of-fastmail-and-how-it-replaced-gma-840d38bc17b) over 6 years ago. I also use it for calendar, and contacts.

Fastmail has an [iOS app](https://www.fastmail.com/help/clients/mobileapp.html), that I use, but none for the Mac so I use the [Fastmate](https://github.com/joelekstrom/fastmate) app which is a native Fastmail-wrapper.

[Messages](https://support.apple.com/explore/messages) – Messages is how I communicate with family and friends.

#### Calendar and Tasks

[Fantastical 3](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) – Fantastical is my calendar and task app. It integrates perfectly with my Fastmail calendar appointments and events and Apple [Reminders](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reminders/id1108187841) tasks.

#### Reading

[Reeder](https://www.reederapp.com/) – Reeder is what I use for my [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/welcome) RSS feeds. Anything that I want to read I save to [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) for reading later.

[Twitter](https://twitter.com) – Twitter is for news and the feeds for apps that I use.

#### Writing

[Drafts 5](https://getdrafts.com/) – I’ve been using Drafts for several years. It’s the launching-off point for text for me. I use the actions to copy it, share it, or deep link into other apps and services.

[iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) – iA Writer is my current writing app of choice. For preview I use [Marked 2](https://marked2app.com/) side by side with iA Writer. Everything that I write goes through [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) for proofreading grammar and spelling.

[Apple Notes](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notes/id1110145109) – Notes that I want to keep long-term go in the Notes app.

#### Utilities / Productivity

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) – Gotta have a password manager.

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) – Alfred is Spotlight on steroids. I’d be lost without it.

[Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) – Keyboard Maestro is another app that I can’t live without it. I use it for keyboard shortcuts, launching apps, opening files and folders and automating actions. It has a learning curve but once you start to get the hang of it you can do amazing things. I’ve written about Keyboard Maestro [here](https://ldstepblog.wordpress.com/category/keyboard-maestro/).

[PopClip](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) – I use PopClip to manage what I do with selected text. I’ve written about PopClip [here](https://ldstephens.net/2017/09/15/how-to-open-the-popclip-menu-on-a-selection/).

[Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/) – Hazel watches whatever folders I tell it to, automatically organizing my files according to the rules that I’ve created.

[Yoink](https://yoink.app/) – Yoink speeds and up my workflow by simplifying drag and drop. I’ve written about Yoink [here](https://ldstephens.net/2017/10/04/yoink-my-favorite-drag-and-drop-utility-for-mac/).

[Dropzone](https://aptonic.com/) – Dropzone makes it easy to copy or move files to my favorite folders, open applications and uploading files to the Internet right from your menu bar.

[App Cleaner](http://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) – AppCleaner is my app uninstaller. I use it because it deletes all the junk that gets left behind when you drag the app icon to the trash.

[Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) – I use Moom for window management.

[Witch](https://manytricks.com/witch/) – Witch is my app switcher.

[Bartender 4](https://www.macbartender.com/Bartender4/) – Bartender is the app I use to organize my menu bar. I’ve written about it [here](https://ldstephens.net/2017/11/15/how-i-organize-my-mac-menu-bar-apps/).

[ScreenFloat](https://eternalstorms.at/ScreenFloat/ScreenFloat_-_Make_your_Shots_fly/ScreenFloat_-_Make_your_Shots_fly%21.html) – ScreenFloat is my app for taking screenshots and storing them.

[TunnelBear VPN](https://www.tunnelbear.com) – TunnelBear is my VPN for security on public WiFi and for web browsing privacy.

[PCalc](https://pcalc.com/) – PCalc is my stock calculator replacement. I use it for its additional features and customization.
