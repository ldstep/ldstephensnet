> Simple text files ("The One True Path," among a certain group.), managed in Obsidian, or in things like DevonThink.[…] If you want to get the most from your practice, first, _have a practice_. Then, stick with one tool. Find one that that appeals to you, doesn't get in your way, and _use it_.[…] If you want something that's _yours_, that's _meaningful to you_, then build a relationship with a tool that serves you, and remain faithful to it. If you outgrow it someday, you'll know. And you'll know what to do.

Dave's post is a long one, but towards the end, he makes a great point about our relationship with our tools. It's so easy to get tempted by the new and shiny, or by whatever someone else is using. But it's hard to build a real relationship with a tool, to really get to know it, if we're always flip-flopping.
