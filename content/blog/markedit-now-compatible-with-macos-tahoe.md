After upgrading my MacBook Pro to macOS 26 Tahoe, [MarkEdit](https://github.com/MarkEdit-app/MarkEdit?tab=readme-ov-file) started having issues. As I recall, the main one was toolbar items locking up. So macOS 26 broke the toolbar and made it unusable, therefore I uninstalled it.

Today I was thinking about how much I miss writing in MarkEdit. So I went to the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/MarkEdit-app/MarkEdit/releases/tag/v1.27.0) and sure enough, there was an macOS 26 release just 4 days ago.

If you are looking for an open-source file-based markdown editor, I can highly recommend it. Check it out.
