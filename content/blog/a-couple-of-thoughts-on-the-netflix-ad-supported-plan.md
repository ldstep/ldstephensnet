[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/sep/05/netflix-to-launch-cheaper-ad-supported-subscription-in-november), Netflix to launch cheaper ad-supported subscription tier in November

> Netflix will reportedly launch a cheaper ad-supported tier for its streaming platform at the start of November as the company tries to stem the loss of more than 1 million subscribers in 2022.

\[…\]

> According to reports, Netflix’s service will launch in the US, France, Germany, Australia and Canada among other places, and is expected to be priced between US$7 and $9. The most basic Netflix subscription now costs US$9.99 or $15.49 for a standard subscription.

​\[…\]

> The ad tier would be additional to the existing tiers, meaning current subscribers would not see any ads on Netflix.

We have subscribed to [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) since we cut the cord several years ago. It’s our most watched streaming service. That said there is no way I would switch to the ad-supported subscription to save a few bucks as has been [suggested](https://www.fiercevideo.com/video/nearly-half-netflix-subs-would-choose-a-cheaper-ad-supported-option) that some might do. I don’t want to see any fucking ads and I sure as hell hope that they don’t start adding ads to the other tiers.

There’s also a risk that the company might [bring ads to the basic and standard tiers](https://www.makeuseof.com/netflix-ad-supported-tier-pros-cons/) in exchange for not hiking prices in the future, especially if the ad-supported tier becomes successful.

On the other hand, for services that we only watch occasionally I don’t mind seeing ads to save a few bucks. For example, we subscribe to the $6.99 ad-supported plan for [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/welcome?orig_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F).
