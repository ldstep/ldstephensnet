I’ll be writing my article about the apps and web services I’ll be using in 2018 soon. Between now and then I’ll be choosing those apps and web services.

I have some prerequisites for next year:

1.  The apps I’ll be using must be cross-platform. That means there must be a Mac, iPhone and iPad app.
2.  I don’t want to manage files anymore. I want to use apps that have an app-based organization.
3.  And lastly, I want to keep subscription-based apps and services to a minimum.

That means there will be some departures from what I’ve done in the past. I’m excited about sharing my must-have apps and web services for 2018 with you.
