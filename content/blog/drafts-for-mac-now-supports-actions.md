I’ve been using [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) for several years. It’s my multi-purpose writing and note-taking app. I often use it as the first stop for most everything I write and then use Drafts actions to send what I’ve written anywhere I want to.

This week Agile Tortoise released Drafts 16 for Mac which now supports [actions and multi-window](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/drafts-16-macos-released-with-action-support/6066). This makes me very happy. With the addition of actions, I can now use Drafts on my Mac just like I do on my iPhone and iPad.

> Actions!
> 
> The full power of Drafts actions, previously only available on the iOS version, are now available for Mac! Integrate with many popular apps and services, and manipulate your drafts and text with scripted actions!
> 
> If you use the iOS version, all your existing actions will automatically sync to the Mac. If not, a default set of actions will be configured.
> 
> Actions are available through the action pane to the right of the main window, via the “Actions” menu, or the Action Bar 19.
