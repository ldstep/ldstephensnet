David Sparks also, known as MacSparky, has released the [iPhone Field Guide](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/iphone-field-guide/id1366611031?ls=1&mt=11&at=10laz7).

I’m a big fan of MacSparky. I’ve gotten a lot of useful tips and learned many tricks reading [his blog](https://www.macsparky.com/) and listening to the [Mac Power Users podcast](https://www.relay.fm/mpu) that he hosts with Katie Floyd. I’ve also watched a number of screencasts that he has done for apps that I use. They are wonderful. A [screencast series](https://agiletortoise.com/drafts/screencasts/) that comes to mind is the one he did for the iOS app [Drafts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lude).

Here are [David’s own words](https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2018/4/announcing-the-iphone-field-guide):

> With the iPhone Field Guide, you’ll learn to get the most from your iPhone with this media-rich book that is sometimes user guide, sometimes opinionated app recommendations, and sometimes iPhone sensei. This book was built entirely in iBooks Author and includes all of the multimedia goodness including screenshots, photo galleries, and video screencasts all engineered to make you an iPhone power user. There are over 50 screencasts adding up to over two hours of video instruction, 450 pages, 44 chapters, and over 65,000 words to help you learn how to squeeze every bit of awesomeness from your iPhone.
>
> The material is accessible to beginners and power users alike with a thoughtful, fun, and systematic approach to iPhone mastery. Moreover, this book is beautifully designed and a joy to read. This is the seventh book in the MacSparky Field Guide series.
