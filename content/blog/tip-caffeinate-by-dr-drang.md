Since I started following [Dr. Drang’s blog](http://leancrew.com/all-this/) I have learned some great Mac tricks. Some I use everyday.

Here’s a new one. Keep your screen awake without having to install one of the popular apps like Caffeine or [Amphetamine](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude). Dr. Drang explains how to do this with a terminal command. No new app needed.

Dr. Drang, [writing on his personal blog](http://leancrew.com/all-this/2017/07/caffeinate/)

> But you know me. Why would I use a nice polished program with a GUI when I can run a Terminal command? And even though I own Bartender, I’d still rather keep my menubar apps to a minimum.
>
> So I use the caffeinate command, whose name, I believe, was lifted from Caffeine in what must be Apple’s lamest piece of Sherlocking ever. It’s a sort of limited version of pmset, the older, more powerful, and considerably more complicated power management utility.
>
> Caffeinate has only a few options and the ones I use are -d, which keeps the display from sleeping, and -t which sets a timer to stop caffeinate in case I forget to. The command I used tonight was
>
> caffeinate -dt 6000
>
> which kept the display awake for 100 minutes (6000 seconds), enough for the 90-minute class plus a cushion.

I highly recommend [Dr. Drang’s blog](http://leancrew.com/all-this/).
