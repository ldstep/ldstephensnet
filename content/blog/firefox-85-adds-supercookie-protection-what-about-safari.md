In technology news today Mozilla announced that it has added built-in protection from supercookies to Firefox 85. “Firefox now protects you from supercookies, a type of tracker that can stay hidden in your browser and track you online, even after you clear cookies,” [Mozilla explains in a blog post](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/01/26/supercookie-protections/). “By isolating supercookies, Firefox prevents them from tracking your web browsing from one site to the next.”

With Safari being my main browser and Firefox being secondary I wondered if Safari might have the same protection from supercookie tracking? To my surprise, it does and has since 2018.

“Quietly and without fanfare Apple has rolled out a change to its Safari browser that munches one of the web’s most advanced “super cookies” into crumbs.” [Apple burns the HSTS super cookie](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/03/20/apple-burns-the-hsts-super-cookie/) WebKit blog: [Protecting Against HSTS Abuse](https://webkit.org/blog/8146/protecting-against-hsts-abuse/)
