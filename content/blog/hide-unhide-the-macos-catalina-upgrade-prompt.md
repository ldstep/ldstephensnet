I don’t know about you but I have no plan to [install macOS Catalina](http://osxdaily.com/2019/10/09/should-i-update-macos-catalina-wait-or-not/) any time soon. And this is the recommendation of many prominent Apple bloggers and podcasters. Why? Catalina is full of potential [problems](http://osxdaily.com/2019/10/09/troubleshooting-macos-catalina-problems/).

That said, I was tired of the Catalina Software Upgrade notice bugging me every day. Here’s how I got rid of it [How to Hide MacOS Catalina from Software Update on Mac](http://osxdaily.com/2019/10/16/hide-macos-catalina-software-update-mac/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+osxdaily+%28OS+X+Daily%29).
