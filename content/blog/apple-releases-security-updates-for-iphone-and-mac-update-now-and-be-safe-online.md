On Monday Apple released security updates [iOS 10.3.2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207798) (for iPhone and iPad users), [MacOS, and OS X](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207797). They also released updates for watchOS 3.2.2, iTunes, Safari, tvOS and iCloud for Windows 6.2.1.

Looking at the list of fixes it is clear that scores of security vulnerabilities have been addressed for iPhones, iPads and Macs.

[US-CERT](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2017/05/15/Apple-Releases-Security-Updates) encourages users and administrators to apply the necessary updates.
