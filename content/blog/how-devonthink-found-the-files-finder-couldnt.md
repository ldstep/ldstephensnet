Recently, I have needed to find some important files that were a few years old. I had forgotten the names of the files, but of course I knew the content of the files and I knew they were on my iCloud Drive. Finder didn’t find the files, no matter how many ways I searched.

I remembered that I had recently indexed my entire iCloud Drive in [Devonthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink). Devonthink’s search capabilities are far superior to Finder. Devonthink doesn’t rely on the traditional search approach that Finder uses. It takes it to a different level by cataloging filenames as well as deeply analyzing the content and context of documents. This means that the system understands the actual content within your files, allowing for highly accurate and relevant search results.

And of course, Devonthink easily found all the files that I was looking for.

Devonthink is a Mac app that can be downloaded for free from the [DEVONtechnologies website](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink). There’s a free trial period of 30 days or 150 hours of runtime, whichever is later. And it’s also a one-time purchase and not a subscription.
