> The story you are about to read is approximately 9,000 words or a 45-50 minutes read. If you’ve ever loved an animal, and one you consider family as I did with my dog, I think you’ll find it well worth your time. It should likely be approached as a mini-book more than an essay. This story is best read with your loving pet right next to you or with the memory of your departed fuzzball top of mind. Thank you for allowing me to share with you the story of a dog that had my heart.

This has been sitting in my GoodLinks to be read for several days. I’ve avoided reading it because I know it’s going to make me cry and probably more than once. I guess I’m looking for the right time to read it. 

But read it I will, Jeff!
