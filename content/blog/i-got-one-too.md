> Disgusting that the Social Security Administration just sent me an email that is essentially a GOP/Trump political ad celebrating a budget that puts Social Security at even more serious risk.

I got one too, and I feel pretty much the same as Jason. But I did learn this: *"the bill ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits, providing meaningful and immediate relief to seniors who have spent a lifetime contributing to our nation's economy."* I checked it out and it's legit. The devil's in the details, though. We'll see how it plays out at tax time.
