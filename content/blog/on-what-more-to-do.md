> Some days, I settle in at the computer, check my mail and read my feeds, then just stare at the thing wondering what else there is to do. I’ve played with nearly every bit of software made. I’ve made dozens of websites and blogs. I’ve changed operating systems. I’ve bought and assembled hardware. I kind of feel like, now what?

That's how I'm feeling this morning. ¯\_(ツ)_/
