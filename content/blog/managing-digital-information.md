I have three main repositories for storing all my digital information:

1. My File Cabinet (iCloud storage)
2. Financial Archive (local storage)
3. Writing (local storage)
    
Everything is indexed in DevonThink for easy access and searchability.

The Writing repository includes current writing projects, journaling, and notes. All writing occurs in Drafts, and upon completion, it is processed into markdown files. If I need to edit a markdown file, I do so in BBEdit.

With DevonThink, I have everything in one place, making it easy to find what I need.

Outside of DevonThink:

- I have a few notes in Apple Notes that include images.
- My 11ty site is on GitHub with a local repository.
