[David McCabe, Tripp Mickle – New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/05/technology/antitrust-apple-lawsuit-us.html)

“The agency is focused on how Apple has used its control over its hardware and software to make it more difficult for consumers to ditch the company’s devices, as well as for rivals to compete, said the people, who spoke anonymously because the investigation was active. Specifically, investigators have examined how the Apple Watch works better with the iPhone than with other brands, as well as how Apple locks competitors out of its iMessage service. They have also scrutinized Apple’s payments system for the iPhone, which blocks other financial firms from offering similar services, these people said.”

“The company prides itself on the way the iPhone integrates hardware and software to create a seamless customer experience. In 2020, Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said during testimony before a congressional antitrust committee that the company redefined mobile phones with “its effortless user experience, its simplicity of design and a high-quality ecosystem.” He added that Apple competed against Samsung, LG, Google and other smartphone makers, which offer a different approach.”

I prefer the Apple’s walled garden. That’s why I left Android years ago. If I didn’t like the walled garden, I would switch back to Android. And now the Justice Department wants to fuck it all up.
