I wanted to let everyone know about some changes to the blog.

At the beginning of this year because of some issues with changes at [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) that made publishing frustrating, I was giving serious consideration to stopping blogging. So I took 45 days off to see how I would feel at the end of the break.

After the break, I realized that I missed blogging and that folks occasionally benefit from something I’ve written. After deciding that I wanted to continue blogging the question became: Where am I going to publish my posts?

I bounced back and forth between Medium, Substack, and Write. as, but they were all limiting in one way or another.

Starting a couple of days ago I decided to start publishing ldstephens on WordPress.com again. As most of you know that’s where ldstephens started as a blog in 2016. Blogging on WordPress.com is going to be more work and at times frustrating, but it’s worth it because it’s the best platform for my blog.

Those of you that follow me by email will get an email each time I post something new. I will be using [Revue](https://www.getrevue.co/) to distribute those emails. Those of you who follow me via WordPress.com will get new post notifications as usual.

Thanks for hanging in there with me and for being a reader.
