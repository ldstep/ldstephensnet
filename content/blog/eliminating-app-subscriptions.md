I know, another post about subscriptions. Some folks don't mind them; others despise them. Over the last year or so, I’ve cut every app subscription from workflow but one — [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com). And when renewal comes up, I probably won’t stick with it. I just don’t see the point when I have apps that I've already paid for, like [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), or those that are free, like Apple Notes.

I don’t mind subscriptions when they make sense. Email, weather data, cloud storage — those are services that require ongoing infrastructure. A recurring fee feels fair in those cases.

But apps aren’t services; they’re tools. I’d rather buy once, own it, and pay for upgrades when it makes sense. The idea of paying every month or year just to keep using the same app doesn’t.
