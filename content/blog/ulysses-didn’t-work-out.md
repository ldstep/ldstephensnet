After [five days with Ulysses](https://ldstephens.net/blog/back-to-ulysses/), I’ve realized it’s not going to replace Drafts. Every time I try a different editor, I end up in the same place: so much of my writing, journaling, daily notes, and text processing runs on Drafts actions. I try to recreate those automations elsewhere, and the other apps just can’t keep up.

Ulysses is a great writing app, it’s just not for me. I’ll be requesting a refund for the subscription.
