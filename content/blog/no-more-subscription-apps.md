I’m on a mission to eliminate all my subscription apps. I only have two more to go. Those would be [Bear](https://bear.app/) and [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/).

Why? I just don’t want to pay for an app over and over year after year especially when I already have other free and paid alternatives that work just as well for me.

**Bear moving to Apple Notes**  
I’ve been using Bear as my notes app since leaving nvAlt a couple of years ago. Back then the Apples Notes app was very basic at best. Over the last couple of years, it’s been much improved. Don’t get me wrong, Bear is a great app. But, I’ve come to realize that I can do all that I need to do in Bear in Apples Notes. For now, I’m running both apps parallel until I’m absolutely positive Notes is going to work for me.

**Ulysses moved to iA Writer**  
I’ve [written about Ulysses](https://ldstephens.net/?s=Ulysses) a lot over the last few years. In my effort to eliminate subscription apps I recently moved all my writing to iA Writer and deleted Ulysses from all my devices and I will not be renewing my subscription.
