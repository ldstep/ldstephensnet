Yesterday I tried to open a .docx document in [Ulysses](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225570693?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude) on my iMac. I figured it must be okay since Ulysses was listed in the right click Open With Menu. Doing so crashed the app big time. After that every time I tried to open Ulysses it would immediately crash. I uninstalled reinstalled the app and it still crashed.

Next, I tried using Ulysses on my MacBook and the same thing happened. So I’m thinking Oh Shit now what do I do. All my documents are in Ulysses and it is crashing every time I open it.

As a last resort I opened Ulysses on my iPad and coincidentally it opened in the Inbox which contained the .docx document that I originally tried to open.  On a flyer, I deleted the document and emptied the trash.

That fixed it. Now everything is working normally again. For some reason, that document was crashing the app.

I found this about [opening .docx files in Ulysses](https://ulyssesapp.com/blog/2016/03/iphone-tip-import-word/).

> When you tap and hold the file, you’ll get prompted with a list of apps available for opening it on your iPhone. Choose Ulysses, and the file will be imported as a Ulysses sheet into your library’s inbox.

According to this blog post opening a .docx file in Ulysses is doable but I won’t be doing it anymore.
