**Update September 5, 2022**: In January 2022 [Instapaper finally received a needed update](https://ldstephens.net/2022/01/20/instapaper-finally-gets-a-badly-needed-update/) with version 8.1. It is currently at version 8.1.2. I have been all in with Instapaper since the update in. In my opinion, it is the best read-it-later app bar none.

 

I recently wrote about [my disappointment with Instapaper,](https://www.instapaper.com/) my long-time read-it-later app. I also wrote an [Open Letter to the Developer](https://ldstephens.net/2022/01/01/open-letter-to-the-developers-of-instapaper/) asking that they either fix the app or sell it. Since I don’t have much hope for either of those things happening, I’ve been on the hunt for a replacement.

There are several other read-it-later apps to choose from. [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/en/), [Reeder](https://www.reederapp.com), [Goodlinks](https://goodlinks.app), [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.app/), [Readwise](https://readwise.io/read), and [UpNext](https://www.getupnext.com/) to name a few. UpNext and Readwise are both in beta and early access sign-up is available. I’ve tested UpNext, and I’m on the early access list for Readwise.

Here’s what I’m looking for in a read-it-later app. A clean, attractive reader view, highlighting, and highlight export.

My number one choice would be Goodlinks. As [I recently wrote](https://ldstephens.net/2020/07/08/goodlinks-for-read-it-later/):

> _In my opinion, GoodLinks is one of the best read-it-later apps out there. The reading experience is excellent. Articles and reading positions sync between devices via iCloud. And best of all it’s a one-time purchase for iPhone, iPad, and Mac._

The only thing that’s missing is highlighting and highlight export. A recent addition to Goodlinks is the ability to export a full article as markdown, plain text, or PDF. I received an email from the developer Ngoc Lou stating “Highlighting and notes are planned. I’m working on it.”

For now, I’ve settled on Matter. It does what I need, plus a lot that I don’t need or want. But it lets me highlight my articles, export the highlights, and save them to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). The reading experience is good but could be better if there were more font choices. Another nice feature is being able to listen to articles.
