I’ve seen a couple of articles lately about [malicious VS Code extensions](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-vscode-extension-in-cursor-ide-led-to-500k-crypto-theft/), and it got me thinking. VS Code kind of intimidates me, there’s a lot going on under the hood that I don’t fully understand. And while I’m not doing anything high-risk, the idea of malicious code still makes me uneasy.

The truth is, my needs are simple. I’m not writing new code. I’m just publishing blog posts and maintaining this site, which is built with 11ty. Every now and then, I tweak a build file.

So I made a change: from now on, I’m doing all of that in [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/). It’s simpler, and I actually know my way around it.

Sometimes peace of mind is the best feature a tool can offer.
