I enjoyed looking through this photo series by Alan Taylor of The Atlantic and thought you might. “As the end of the year approaches, here is a look back at some of the major news moments of 2023. Events covered in this essay (the first of a three-part photo summary of the year) include heavy snowfall in California, following an atmospheric river of storms; livestreamers on the street in China; Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine; the passing of a distant comet; a devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria; and much more.”
