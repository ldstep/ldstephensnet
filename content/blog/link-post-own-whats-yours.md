> The most reliable way to publish ideas and have them remained published is on a site you control.[…] Is taking control of your content less convenient? Yeah–of course. That’s how we got in this mess to begin with. It can be a downright pain in the ass. But it’s _your_ pain in the ass. And that’s the point.[…] This isn’t the post to tell you what tools you should or should not use. It doesn’t matter as long as you own what comes from it. It can be something like Obsidian. It can be plain-ol’ HTML and CSS. It doesn’t matter–as much as folks want you to think it does.[…] Take your ideas, your words, your work–and go home.

I always find it enjoyable to read others’ perspectives on blogs and blogging.
