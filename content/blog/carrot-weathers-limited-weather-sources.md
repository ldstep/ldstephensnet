I recently [wrote about weather apps](https://ldstephens.net/blog/weather-apps/) and their importance in my area. In that post, I mentioned my love for Carrot Weather, but noted that the available weather sources are not accurate for central New Jersey. The most reliable sources for my region are The Weather Channel and Weatherbit.

As my Carrot subscription is up for renewal in a couple of months, I decided to reach out to the developer and suggest that they add these sources to Carrot. I don’t think my request is unreasonable for such a great app. Hello Weather offers 11 weather source options, including The Weather Channel and Weatherbit, compared to Carrot's 7 sources—almost twice as many.

I know I’m just one person making this request, so I’m sure it may be overlooked. However, I can't be the only one wishing for additional source options in Carrot. Unless something changes, I will not be renewing my subscription.
