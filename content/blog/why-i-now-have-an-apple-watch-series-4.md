I’ve been wearing a sports activity watch for several years. My main use case is to track my runs and to make sure that I meet my personal goal of 10,000 steps per day. I’ve been doing this with a [Garmin Forerunner 35](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/552962) and the Garmin Connect iOS app.

A couple of weeks ago my wife and I were in our local Apple Store to have the contents on her old MacBook Pro migrated to her new MacBook Air. While we were there I spent a few minutes checking out the new Series 4 Apple Watch.

I was interested in the Apple Watch because I had just read [Joe Cieplinski article](https://joecieplinski.com/blog/2019/03/28/i-now-have-a-cardiologist/) about the [Apple Watch detecting an irregular heartbeat](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208931). If I’m not mistaken he discovered that he had A-Fib using the [ECG feature](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208955). Then within a few days, Stephen Hackett on [Connected Episode 238](https://www.relay.fm/connected/238) talked about a fall he had taken on his bike and how the [Apple Watch Fall Detection](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208944) worked. Now, these are both areas that are of interest to me. I have a history of heart problems and as I’ve gotten older I find that I’m more prone to losing my balance and possibly taking a tumble.

The heart features of the Apple Watch and Fall Detection are why I now own one. Because the Apple Watch also has wonderful activity tracking I now use it to also track my runs and step count. So, what did I do with my Forerunner 35? I gave it to my wife since her Fitbit was about to die.
