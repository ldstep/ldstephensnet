The other day [I wrote that I was selling my old iMac](https://ldstephens.net/2019/07/11/selling-my-imac/) and that I was selling it to [Sell Your Mac](https://www.sellyourmac.com/).

At first, I was a bit apprehensive to sell it to someone other than [Gazelle](https://www.gazelle.com) but since they are no longer buying Macs I had no choice.

Selling my iMac to Sell Your Mac was simple and payment was fast. I got a quote, shipped my iMac to them, and had a check for the amount quoted within a few days.

If you’re looking to sell Apple hardware be sure to get a quote from Sell Your Mac. And, don’t let the name fool you. They buy all of Apples hardware Mac, iPhone, iPad and more.
