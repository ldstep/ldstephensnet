Every year at this time I toss and turn over whether I should get a new iPhone. My current iPhone is a 7 Plus that I purchased under Apple’s Upgrade Program. Last year I passed on upgrading to the iPhone X. I just didn’t see a compelling reason to do so other than to have the newest iPhone. I find myself in the same position this year. My 7 Plus does everything I want from a phone.

So here’s what I plan to do. I’m going to take this recommendation [Don’t buy any of the new iPhones announced this week until you’ve downloaded iOS 12 to your current iPhone](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ios-12-new-iphones-release-date-2018-9) from Business Insider.

> If you’re considering buying any of the fancy new iPhones that Apple announced on Wednesday and are already an iPhone user, wait until iOS 12 is released before deciding.
> 
> Apple will release iOS 12 on Monday.
> 
> iOS 12 brings a ton of changes to the iPhone, including faster performance on older devices. After you’ve tried it, you may not feel like upgrading.
