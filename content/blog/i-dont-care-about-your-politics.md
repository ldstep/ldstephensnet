> I have a long-standing position on politics: don’t make your politics my problem, and I won’t let mine become yours.

> I am not saying that I don’t have strong political feelings because I do, but I am saying that I’m not interested in discussing that topic with anyone I wouldn’t hug. This seems to be the healthiest approach.

Whether I agree with or disagree with your politics, I don’t want to read about them. If you must write about them, I’ll remove you from my RSS feed. I agree with Sam. We all have political views, and as divided as we are over those views, the healthiest approach is to not fucking discuss them.
