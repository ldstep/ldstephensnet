I recently made the decision to open an [Apple Card new high-yield Savings account](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/04/apple-cards-new-high-yield-savings-account-is-now-available-offering-a-4-point-15-percent-apy/). Not only does it allow me to earn interest on my Apple Card Daily Cash, it also provides a seamless way to transfer money between my accounts. Setting up and using the Apple Savings account is incredibly easy user-friendly.

Here’s how to get started:

In order to open and maintain an Apple Savings account, you need to meet the following criteria: be the owner or co-owner of an active Apple Card account, have your Apple Card added to your device, be at least 18 years old, have a social security number or individual taxpayer identification number, be a U.S. resident with a valid U.S. address, have two-factor authentication enabled for your Apple ID, and have your device updated with the latest iOS version.

To set up your Apple Savings account, open the Wallet app on your iPhone or go to Settings and select Wallet & Apple Pay. Tap on “Apple Card” and then the More button. Tap “Set Up” next to “Savings” and follow the onscreen instructions. You may be asked if you want to transfer funds from your Apple Cash balance to your new account to start earning interest.

To send money to your Apple Savings account, open the Wallet app, tap on “Apple Card,” and select “Savings account.” Choose “Add Money,” enter the desired amount, and select the payment source. Confirm the action with Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode.

To view your Apple Savings balance, open the Wallet app, tap on “Apple Card,” and select “Savings account.” You can see your current balance, including pending transactions or deposits. To view your available balance for withdrawal, tap the More button and then “Account Details.”

If you’re an Apple Card user and seeking a hassle-free solution to grow your savings, consider an Apple Savings account.
