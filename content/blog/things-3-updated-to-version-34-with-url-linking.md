Things 3 is my [favorite task manager](https://ldstephens.net/2017/10/17/things-3-for-personal-task-management/).

With today’s update to version 3.4 Things now has URL linking, app handover, and automation capabilities. I don’t have a need for these new features but more advanced users are going to be very excited.

For a more detailed explanation of the new features go to [Culture Code’s blog post](https://culturedcode.com/things/blog/2018/02/hey-things/).

For new users, Things 3.4 can be downloaded from the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904280696?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude) for $49.99 and the iOS App Store. The [iPad version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3-for-ipad/id904244226?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lude) is priced at $19.99 while the [iPhone version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lude) (which includes Apple watch support) is priced at $9.99.
