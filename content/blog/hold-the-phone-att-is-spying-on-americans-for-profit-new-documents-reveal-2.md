Did you read the article today, in the [Daily Beast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/25/at-t-is-spying-on-americans-for-profit.html), about AT&T’s just revealed highly secretive Hemisphere Program?

Kenneth Lipp, [Writing for The Daily Beast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/25/at-t-is-spying-on-americans-for-profit.html)

> The telecom giant is doing NSA-style work for law enforcement—without a warrant—and earning millions of dollars a year from taxpayers.

> Hemisphere is a secretive program run by AT&T that searches trillions of call records and analyzes cellular data to determine where a target is located, with whom he speaks, and potentially why.

AT&T is collecting and storing this data on every customer not just the bad guys as illustrated in the article. There in lies the problem.

We the American people’s privacy is constantly being violated. We are being spied upon by our government, law enforcement and telecoms. We are being tracked by the likes of Google, Facebook, Yahoo and who knows how many more third parties. [Disconnect.me](https://disconnect.me/disconnect) says that it’s private browsing product blocks 2000 plus tracking sites. Then there are the yet unknown ways we are being spied on or tracked.
