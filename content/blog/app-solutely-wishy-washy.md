I find myself constantly switching between different apps, services, and devices. What the fuck is up with me? Why can’t I just settle on what works best for me and stop this endless cycle of app flip-flopping?

My challenge lies in my susceptibility to the influence of other Apple enthusiasts. If they’re using a particular app, I find myself questioning whether I should be following suit.

Recently, [I browsed through some default apps blog posts](https://defaults.rknight.me/), evaluating how many people were using Reeder versus NetNewWire and whether they were using Feedbin or iCloud for their backend. This sparked my interest because my Feedbin subscription is up for renewal in a few weeks, and I’m considering eliminating it.

Another area that piqued my curiosity was the notes and writing apps that others were using. I was particularly interested in how many people were using Drafts, an app I love for all my text-based needs. However, noticing that Drafts wasn’t as popular as I’d expected made me question whether I should switch to Ulysses or iA Writer, which were mentioned more frequently.

I’m sure you get the gist of my problem. My goal for 2024 is to finally settle on the apps that genuinely work for me and break free from this endless cycle of app flip-flopping. How about you?
