I read a [post by Cassidy Williams](https://cassidoo.co/post/new-blog-topics/) this morning about how hard it can be to come up with blog topics, especially when you’re trying to write every day for a challenge like December’s Blogvent. Instead of waiting for the perfect idea, she just starts writing and lets a topic reveal itself.

That got me thinking about a post I wrote last year, where I questioned whether [blogging challenges are worth it](https://ldstephens.net/blog/blogging-challenges-are-they-really-worth-it/). I’d just finished a couple of them and found myself struggling each day to come up with something to say. And honestly, some days I don’t have anything to say. Forcing words onto the page just to keep up with a streak doesn’t feel great.

I think that’s when I realized blogging challenges aren’t for me. I’d rather write less often and mean it, than publish something just to check a box. When I have something to say, I’ll write. When I don’t, that’s okay too.
