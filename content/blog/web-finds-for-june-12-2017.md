Web Finds are from my web surfing travels. You’ll find some unique, informative, and some of the coolest websites and apps that you may have never known existed. Enjoy!

**[Screenfloats](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/screenfloat-more-useful-screenshots/id414528154?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude)  
**Use ScreenFloat for Mac to create floating screenshots that are always visible, no matter which application you’re in. This way, you don’t have to move or resize windows around to keep information visible on your screen. You can send shots created with ScreenFloat to any application that handles image files. I love this app.

**[Yoink  
](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yoink-improved-drag-drop-file-management/id457622435?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude)**Yoink for Mac simplifies and improves drag and drop between windows, apps, spaces and fullscreen apps. When you start dragging files in Finder or content from an application, Yoink fades in a tiny window at the edge of your screen so you can drag to it. This frees up your mouse so you can comfortably navigate to the destination of the files and resume the drag from Yoink’s window more comfortably.

**[TwitRSS.me  
](https://twitrss.me/)**Get a twitter user feed or search as a RSS.

**[2017 Apple Design Awards  
](https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/)**This year’s Apple Design Award winners were announced at WWDC last week. The thirteen apps selected at this years awards include 5 games and 7 apps for iOS.
