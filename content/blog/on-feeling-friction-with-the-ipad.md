> There are apps for the iPad, which you can use to write code. The one I've used most for this has been [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/?ref=journeysthroughglass.net). But while it's a good _editor_, you can't actually run your code.[…] However, it appears that because of the iPad's limitations. If you want to run code, you need to run it somewhere else.[…] It's not even if other developers could make better software for the iPad, as there are various App Store rules that restrict the downloading, compilation, and running of code.

I've been running the iPadOS 26 beta, hoping to use the iPad as my primary device. But I have the same problem as Chris. This site is built with 11ty, and there's no way to run the code on iPad. I need a Mac for that, so why even bother having an iPad? Yeah, I know there are other things you can do on an iPad, but I can do most of those on my Mac or iPhone anyway.
