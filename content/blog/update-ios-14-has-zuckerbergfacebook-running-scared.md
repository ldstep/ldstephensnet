I’ve been working on an article about the [iOS 14 privacy feature](https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising) that has Facebook and other advertisers running scared. [Facebook acknowledged](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/26/facebook-apple-ios-14-could-cut-audience-network-revenue-in-half.html) that Apple’s upcoming iOS 14 could lead to a more than 50% drop in its Audience Network advertising business. (Doesn’t that just break your heart)

Today to my disappointment, [Apple is holding off on introducing the default feature](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/apple-delay-ios-14-privacy-ad-tracking/) until early next year to allow developers more time to make the necessary changes to their apps. I guess this makes everything I’ve written all for naught. Oh, well.

By the way, did you know that you can [manually limit targeted advertising and reset your identifier](https://www.intego.com/mac-security-blog/how-to-reset-the-advertising-identifier-on-your-mac-ios-device-or-apple-tv/)? If you do this an app will still be able to access your IDFA but it makes it much harder to build a profile on you. I reset my identifier once a month.

> The advertising identifier on an Apple device does not identify you personally, but it can be used by advertisers to create a profile about you. If it’s never reset, that profile increases in detail, allowing advertisers to target ads to you based on your Internet activity.
