Each year towards the end of December I summarize in a post, on this site, the Mac, iPhone, and iPad apps that I will be using for the next year. This is always one of my most popular posts.

This year instead of a separate article for Mac apps and another for iPhone and iPad apps I’m putting them all in one article. I indicate in parenthesis under the app title where I’m using the app Mac, iPhone or iPad.

During 2019 I tried a lot of different apps. Some I liked and switched to and others I tried, didn’t like and stayed with what I’d been using. I hope you’ll discover a new app or two that will improve your workflow or make you more productive.

## My setup:

-   MacBook Pro (early–2015 13”)
-   iPhone 7 Plus
-   iPad 5th Generation
-   Apple Watch 44 mm Series 4

### Here’s my software and what I use it for:

**Safari**  
(Mac, iPhone, and iPad)  
Safari is my browser of choice. It just works best on macOS. I use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) when a site doesn’t play nice with it.

**[Enpass](https://www.enpass.io/)**  
(Mac, iPhone, and iPad)  
Gotta have a password manager.

**[Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=14726057)**  
(Mac, iPhone, and iPad)  
I’ve been using Fastmail for email for over 5 years. A few weeks ago I also started using it for calendar, and contacts. On my iPhone and iPad, I use the Fastmail app. Unfortunately, Fastmail doesn’t have a Mac app but with [Unite](https://www.bzgapps.com/unite) I turned the Fastmail web client into a native Mac app. I’ve written about Fastmail [here](https://ldstephens.net/2017/04/17/two-years-of-fastmail-and-how-it-replaced-gmail/).

**[Fantastical 2](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)**  
(Mac, iPhone, and iPad)  
Fantastical is my calendar app. It integrates perfectly with my Fastmail calendar appointments and events.

**[Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/)**  
(Mac, iPhone, and iPad)  
I use Things 3 for task management. I love the simplicity of how it works. I wrote about it [here](https://ldstephens.net/2017/10/17/things-3-for-personal-task-management/).

**[Due](https://www.dueapp.com/)**  
(iPhone and iPad)  
Due is where I keep all my reminders.

**[Drafts 5](https://getdrafts.com/)**  
(Mac, iPhone, and iPad)  
I’ve been using Drafts for several years. It’s my multi-purpose writing and note-taking app. I often use it as the first stop for most everything I write and then use Drafts actions to send what I’ve written anywhere I want to. I’ve written about how I use Drafts [here](https://ldstephens.net/2017/03/31/getting-drafts-right/).

**[Bear](https://bear.app/)**  
(Mac, iPhone, and iPad)  
I’ve been a Bear pro user since the inception of the app. It’s where I keep all my notes and lists. For now, it’s also where I’m doing my writing. And for plain text I use [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) on my Mac and [1Writer](http://1writerapp.com/) on my iPhone and iPad.

**[Marked 2](https://marked2app.com/)**  
(Mac)  
Marked is the markdown previewer app I use side by side with my writing app.

**[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com)**  
(Mac and iPad)  
I use Grammarly for proofreading my stories for grammar and punctuation.

**[Yoink](https://yoink.app/)**  
(Mac, iPhone, and iPad)  
Yoink speeds and up my workflow by simplifying drag and drop. I’ve written about Yoink [here](https://ldstephens.net/2017/10/04/yoink-my-favorite-drag-and-drop-utility-for-mac/).

**[Copied](https://copiedapp.com/)**  
(Mac, iPhone, and iPad)  
Copied is my cross-platform clipboard history manager. I’ve written about it [here](https://ldstephens.net/2017/02/13/my-favorite-clipboard-manager-for-ios-and-macos/).

**[Reeder](https://www.reederapp.com/)**  
(Mac, iPhone, and iPad)  
Reeder is what I use for my **[Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/welcome)** RSS feeds.

**[Pocket](https://getpocket.com/)**  
(Mac, iPhone, and iPad)  
I’m now using Pocket instead of Instapaper for reading later. I wrote about why I switched [here](http://ldstephens.net/2019/10/07/switched-to-pocket-from-instapaper/).

**[Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/)**  
(iPhone and iPad)  
Tweetbot is for Twitter.

**[Day One Journal](https://dayoneapp.com/)**  
(iPhone and iPad)  
Day One is where I keep a lifelog.

**[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com)**  
(Mac)  
Alfred is Spotlight on steroids. I’d be lost without it. I’ve written about it [here](https://ldstepblog.wordpress.com/category/alfred/).

**[Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/)**  
(Mac)  
Keyboard Maestro is another app that I couldn’t live without it. I use Keyboard Maestro keyboard shortcuts to launch apps, open files and folders and automating actions. It has a learning curve but once you start to get the hang of it you can do some amazing things. I’ve written about Keyboard Maestro [here](https://ldstepblog.wordpress.com/category/keyboard-maestro/).

**[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)**  
(Mac, iPhone, and iPad)  
Dropbox is where I keep files that I want to have available on all my devices. It’s also where syncing happens for apps like Alfred, Keyboard Maestro, and Due.

**[PDFpen](https://smilesoftware.com/pdfpen-family)** and **[Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/)** are key apps for my paperless workflow. I’ve written about my paperless workflow [here](https://ldstephens.net/2017/05/21/ive-gone-paperless/).

**[Scanner Pro](https://readdle.com/scannerpro)**  
(iPhone and iPad)  
Scanner Pro is also part of my paperless workflow. I use it to scan paper documents into PDFs with OCR that look clean and professional.

**[App Cleaner](http://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/)**  
(Mac)  
AppCleaner is my app uninstaller. I use it because it deletes all the junk that gets left behind when you just drag the app icon to the trash.

**[Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/)**  
(Mac)  
I use Moom for window management on my Mac.

**[Witch](https://manytricks.com/witch/)**  
(Mac)  
Witch is my Mac app switcher.

**[PopClip](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/)**  
(Mac)  
I use PopClip to manage what I do with selected text. I’ve written about PopClip [here](https://ldstephens.net/2017/09/15/how-to-open-the-popclip-menu-on-a-selection/).

**[Bartender 3](https://www.macbartender.com/)**  
(Mac)  
Bartender is the app I use to organize my menu bar. I’ve written about it [here](https://ldstephens.net/2017/11/15/how-i-organize-my-mac-menu-bar-apps/).

**[ScreenFloat](https://eternalstorms.at/ScreenFloat/ScreenFloat_-_Make_your_Shots_fly/ScreenFloat_-_Make_your_Shots_fly%21.html)**  
(Mac)  
ScreenFloat is my app for taking screenshots and storing them.

**[TunnelBear VPN](https://www.tunnelbear.com)**  
(Mac, iPhone, and iPad)  
TunnelBear is my VPN for security on public WiFi and web browsing privacy.

**[PCalc](https://pcalc.com/)**  
(Mac, iPhone, and iPad)  
PCalc is my stock calculator replacement. I use it for its additional features and customization.

**Apple Activity app**  
I use the Activity app with my Apple Watch to track all my daily activities.
