Back in May 2021, I wrote that I had [one wish for iPadOS 15](https://ldstephens.net/2021/05/29/my-one-wish-for-ipados-15/) “I would like to see the Files app become a true Finder equivalent. I want the ability to view a file’s extension and to be able to change it.”

Well, we didn’t get file extensions in iPadOS 15 but we did get them this year in iPadOS 16 and iOS 16. It’s not talked about much, so many of you may not realize this exists.

Here’s how to enable file extensions in iPadOS 16 and iOS 16:

Open files > Go to any folder or directory with files in it, then choose the List/Icon sort menu > Find the submenu for View Options, and under that choose Show All Extensions.
