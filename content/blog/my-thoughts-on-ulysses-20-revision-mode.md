[Ulysses 20 – Ulysses Blog](https://blog.ulysses.app/ulysses-20/)

> We added an “advanced text check” to revision mode, which offers informed suggestions on capitalization, punctuation, semantics, redundancy, style and typography. We partnered with LanguageTooler for this, a fellow German company which develops the magnificent LanguageTool Plus. As a matter of fact, we fully integrated LT Plus into Ulysses, so you now have access to its comprehensive set of grammar and style rules right from within Ulysses!

I use the free version of [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to check spelling, grammar, and punctuation before publishing my articles. Now that Ulysses has [LanguageTool Plus](https://languagetoolplus.com/) built-in I wanted compare it’s results to Grammarly’s. To compare I first ran my articles through LanguageTool Plus and made the suggested changes. I then ran the same articles through Grammarly and in every case, Grammarly found additional items for correction. Based on that comparison I’ll be sticking with Grammarly.
