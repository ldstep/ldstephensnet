> Maybe it is the right time for this love affair to come to an end. Not the end of my love for what I can do with Apple stuff, but creating boundaries, something good for any relationship. From Tim Cook down, executives—Schiller excepted—have proven themselves unworthy of our trust. As shepherds of the company, they have revealed themselves. I may still love the concept of Apple, but certainly the company no more.

For a long time, I've sided with Apple in its ongoing legal battle with Epic Games. I believed that since Apple built the platform, it had every right to set the terms, including its much debated 27% commission on external purchases. To me, it seemed only fair that if you want to use the App Store, you play by Apple's rules. After all, it's their ecosystem, their infrastructure, and their investment. Why should Epic or anyone else get to use that for free?

But the latest revelations have shifted my perspective. If the leadership is comfortable misleading courts and lie to protect revenue streams, what else are they willing to do? It's disappointing, and it's enough to make me rethink how I view Apple.

I'm not jumping ship, but I'm definitely looking at Apple differently. And I think Glenn has the right perspective on that.
