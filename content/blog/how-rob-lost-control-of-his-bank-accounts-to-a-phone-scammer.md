I’ve been following [Rob’s blog](https://robservatory.com) for several years. I enjoy reading what he writes about. He is also the developer of a couple of [Mac apps](https://manytricks.com) that I use.

I felt bad for Rob after reading his blog post about how he had recently lost control of his bank accounts to a phone scammer. His story is well worth reading. It may save you from falling for the same or similar phone scams.
