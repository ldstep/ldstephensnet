With iOS 14, Apple is requiring app developers to tell users about and have them opt-in to tracking. Google today [announced](https://www.blog.google/products/ads-commerce/preparing-developers-and-advertisers-for-policy-updates/) that “when Apple’s policy goes into effect, it will no longer use information (such as IDFA) that falls under ATT for the handful of our iOS apps that currently use it for advertising purposes. As such, we will not show the ATT prompt on those apps, [in line with Apple’s guidance](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#user-tracking).”

I don’t use Google’s apps but for those of you who do this should be a welcome change.
