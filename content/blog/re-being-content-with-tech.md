[Brandon](https://whatsacomputer.com/posts/being-content-with-tech) 

> A recent example of this is that I recently sold my 13” iPad Pro and wanted to use the funds for a new M4 MacBook Air that I have had my eye on for several months. Best Buy just happened to have it on sale so I jumped on it. However, after spending several days with it, I realized that while it is super nice, I don’t actually need it. My M1 Pro MacBook Pro from 2021 is still an awesome computer that does everything that I need.

I recently [replaced](https://ldstephens.net/blog/m4-macbook-pro/) my M1 MacBook Air with a base-model M4 MacBook Pro. Like Brandon, after a few days with it I couldn’t really tell much difference from the M1 Air and I pretty much expected that. I would’ve been perfectly content with the Air, but the larger screen on the Pro was the real draw. That’s also why I skipped the M4 Air. It wouldn’t have given me anything extra when what I really wanted was a bigger display for my aging eyes.

In the end, it’s a good reminder that being content with what we have is usually good enough.
