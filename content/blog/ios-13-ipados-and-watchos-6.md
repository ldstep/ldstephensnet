A couple of days ago I installed iOS 13 on my iPhone and iPadOS on my iPad. I’ve taken some time to review the new features in both OS’s. I did that by watching the below videos by 9to5 Mac and found them to be very informative.

-   [iPadOS 13.1: Top Features & Changes for iPad!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_bz5Xnd9KM)
-   [watchOS 6: Top Features & Changes for Apple Watch!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szJ3AZf28n4)  
    

With iOS 13 I don’t see much that will change how I use my iPhone. On the other hand, I see quite a bit in iPadOS that will change how I use my iPad. Particularly the multitasking features.

The upgrade on my Apple Watch didn’t go smoothly. I’m not sure how to explain this but my Watch update was stuck on an old update 5.3.2 that never finished downloading and installing. My Watch was actually on 5.3.1. I got a message that the install was paused because I needed to connect the Watch to WiFi. So I did that but it was still stalled. As a last resort, I rebooted my iPhone and Watch and went back into the Watch software update and the stall cleared its self out and then the 6.1 update appeared. After that, the install completed with no problems. Bye the way, I like the new California watch faces in watchOS 6. Very cool!

As for macOS Catalina on my MacBook Pro? Well, that’s going to have to wait. It is [riddled with problems](https://www.google.com/search?ei=Z6a5XarhOrHr5gKW3roY&q=macOS+catalina+problems&oq=macOS+catalina+problems&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i324j0j0i22i30j0i22i10i30j0i22i30l6.36235.43370..45019...2.0..0.100.1173.15j1......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i67j0i131j0i10j0i13j0i13i30j0i8i13i30.Xu0K8gIagMQ&ved=0ahUKEwjqsJ_boMTlAhWxtVkKHRavDgMQ4dUDCAo&uact=5) that I don’t want to deal with. I might not Catalina and just wait for next years macOS update in hopes that it will be a stability update.
