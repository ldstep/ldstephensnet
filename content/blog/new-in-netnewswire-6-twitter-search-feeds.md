The RSS news-reader app [NetNewsWire 6 beta](https://nnw.ranchero.com/2021/03/13/netnewswire-b-for.html) now has the ability to add Twitter searches and read them as if they were any other kind of feed. This is a nice addition if you are a NetNewsWire user. I wish [Reeder](https://reederapp.com) had this feature.
