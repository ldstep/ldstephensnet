I used to love [Medium](https://medium.com/) but I’ve become disillusioned with the new direction it has been taking both from a reading and writing stand point. Looking for interesting stories to read used to be simple. Not anymore. Medium was a place for the little guy to write and hopefully get noticed by a few people. Not anymore.

I know the folks at Medium are looking for a way to make money but I’m not sure the changes they’re making are going to get them there. There are those who think Medium is destined for ultimate failure.

> This has been the concern with Medium since the very beginning. Because they defaulted to Medium-branded user blogs on medium.com instead of your own blog at a personal domain name, there was a risk that if Medium didn’t work out as a business, many great posts would disappear along with the service. You might get more readers in the short-term, but it’s a bad trade-off when links break and you have to start all over again.

I’ve been re-publishing the original content that I write here on Medium since I started this blog. Not anymore.
