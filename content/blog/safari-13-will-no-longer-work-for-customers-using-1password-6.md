It was very disappointing to read that [1Password 6 will stop working with Safari 13](https://blog.1password.com/safari-13-is-awesome-upgrade-from-1password-6/).

> On Monday, Apple released the macOS Catalina public beta that includes a preview of Safari 13, which is set for release this fall. We’ve discovered there’s [lots to love](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari_release_notes/safari_13_beta_release_notes) about Safari 13, but we’ve also learned that it will no longer work for customers using 1Password 6.

I moved from [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) to [1Password](https://www.lastpass.com/) when LastPass had a security issue a few years ago. Another thing with LastPass, I didn’t like having my passwords on LastPass’ servers. At that time the 1Password vault was locally stored which is what I was looking for.

Now, here’s my dilemma. One, 1Password 7 is a subscription, which I don’t want, or I could buy the upgrade for the standalone version at $49.99 which I don’t want to do either since 1Password 6 does everything I need.

Here are my options:

1Password 6 will continue to work in Firefox and Chrome so I could switch to Firefox.

> 1Password 6 will continue to work with other browsers. Safari lovers like myself won’t want to hear this one, but if you’re stuck and really can’t upgrade, you can still use 1Password 6 in Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Vivaldi.

Or I could switch password managers and continue using Safari as my preferred browser. I have [Enpass](https://www.enpass.io/) installed on my Macs, and iOS devices but haven’t used it. One thing I like about Enpass is vaults are locally stored and can sync via iCloud. I also like that Enpass is a purchase and not a subscription.

Over the next few weeks, I’m going to experiment with my options.
