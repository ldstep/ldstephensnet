We have daily chores: in the morning, it’s feeding the animals and walking Trix so she can take care of her business. Lisa usually handles the feeding while I walk Trix, but she’s away on a trip, so I’m doing it all this week.

For years, a feral cat (whom we affectionately call Mouse because she kept the mice and rats away from the chicken coop) has come by morning and evening to eat. Her bowl sits on top of the woodpile. Sometimes she’d even hang around during the day. But lately, she hasn’t been around, and I think I know why.

This spring, two mom foxes had babies in the woods around us, making our yard their playground. I’m guessing one of the moms has been getting to the food first. Maybe Mouse showed up to an empty bowl a few too many times and gave up.

Lisa still puts food out, just in case. But today, I didn’t. I watched as the fox came looking, found nothing, and quietly wandered off. That moment hit me harder than I expected. I don’t know if it was guilt or just sadness, but I almost went back and put the food out. I didn’t. But it wasn’t easy.

Anyway, now that the babies are no longer babies, they’ll all wander off, and maybe Mouse will be back. We really miss her!
