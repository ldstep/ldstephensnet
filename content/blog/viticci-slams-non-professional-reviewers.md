Mere Civilian: [The value of a non-reviewer’s perspective](https://merecivilian.com/the-value-of-a-non-reviewers-perspective/)

> Sometimes, I hear something and I find the need to consider what my thoughts are on a particular subject. This is one of those times.

> In the first seven minutes of the episode 242 of the AppStories Podcast. Federico said:

> “You wouldn’t want to read/or watch a review by someone who is not a professional reviewer. It wouldn’t be enjoyable.”

​\[…\]

> However, I strongly disagree with the first sentence. I frequently seek reviews written by people who are not professional reviewers.

If you’re wondering who Federico is he is Federico Viticci – Founder and Editor-in-chief of MacStories. He is also co-host of the AppStories podcast with John Voorhees.

I’m not a regular listener of AppStories but this week I was interested in [hearing what Federico and John had to say about the new iPad Mini](https://appstories.net/posts/the-ipad-mini-small-wonder).

Like Mere Civilian when I heard Federico say “You wouldn’t want to read/or watch a review by someone who is not a professional reviewer. It wouldn’t be enjoyable.” I was shocked. Who and the hell does he think he’s speaking for? Obviously, not me and a few others.

> I don’t listen to App Stories but I do listen to Connected and generally read MacStories but right now I feel really let down. I’ll let you listen to the podcast in question but like I say as a fellow blogger trying to make my way through this online world it’s a let down and shows a lot of **hubris**.

> This was an incredibly bone-headed comment from Federico. I would rather read a review from someone that isn’t a professional reviewer. I don’t want a phone review from someone that does phone reviews for a living because their perspective is skewed.

My take is that Federico has gotten too big for his britches.
