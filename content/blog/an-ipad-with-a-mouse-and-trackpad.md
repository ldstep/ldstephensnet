[9to5 Mac](https://9to5mac.com/) is reporting that [sophisticated mouse cursor support is coming to iOS 14 and that new iPad Smart Keyboard models will have a trackpad](https://9to5mac.com/2020/03/09/sophisticated-mouse-cursor-support-coming-to-ios-14-new-ipad-smart-keyboard-models-with-trackpad/).

> According to code seen by 9to5Mac, Apple is set to roll out rich system-wide support for mouse cursors with iOS 14. Apple added rudimentary compatibility with external mice in iOS 13 Accessibility settings, but iOS 14 (iPadOS 14) will make it mainstream.
> 
> The iOS 14 build also referenced two new Smart Keyboard models in development.
> 
> The changes coming to the software will bring most of the cursor features you recognize from a Mac desktop experience to iOS.

I love it and Iâ€™m looking forward to it. This seems like something that could get me closer to making an iPad my main computing device.
