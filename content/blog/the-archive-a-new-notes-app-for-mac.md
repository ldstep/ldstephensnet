There’s a new notes app out called the [The Archive](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/). If you have used Brett Terpstra’s [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) this app will look very familiar to you.

> The Archive is designed around what Notational Velocity and later nvALT brought to the Mac: Fast, reliable search with ease of creation. As both of these applications lost their luster as macOS advanced, I left them behind in a favor of less buggy and more versatile tools. The Archive is the first application to come along that is really making me reconsider moving my note collection out of Dropbox.

> **The Archive** owes a huge debt to **nvALT**. The developers acknowledge that debt explicitly. The Archive is nvALT improved.

I downloaded and played with The Archive for a few days. I found it to be a very nice and an improvement over nvALT. If I hadn’t moved my notes from nvALT to [Bear](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear-beautiful-writing-app/id1091189122?mt=12&at=1000lude) last year I would definitely consider using The Archive as my notes app. For now, I’m too invested in Bear to change.

Macosxguru wrote a nice [review of The Archive](http://bicycleforyourmind.com/the_archive_review). I suggest giving it a read.
