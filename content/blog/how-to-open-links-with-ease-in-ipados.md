I recently stumbled upon a feature in iPadOS! It’s called “Open Link,” and it’s a game-changer, especially if you work with a text editor on iPadOS or iOS.

So, here’s the deal: you’re editing text and come across some links. Naturally, you’d want to open those links in Safari, right? But unfortunately, in a text editor, links aren’t clickable, making it a bit of a hassle to open them directly.

Well, fear not! In the latest iPadOS 16 and iOS 16 updates, Apple introduced a solution. Now, when you encounter a link in your text editor, simply select it and give it a [right-click](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2020/06/08/ipad-right-click-tutorial/) action and a nifty “Open Link” option pops up in the menu!

I’m guessing you might already know about this feature, but for me, it was an exciting discovery. Now, opening links on my iPad has become a breeze, and I thought you’d find it just as handy!
