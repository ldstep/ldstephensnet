I ran across these two articles in my RSS feed yesterday and thought that they were worthy of sharing.

**[Apple releases new COVID-19 app and website based on CDC guidance](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/03/apple-releases-new-covid-19-app-and-website-based-on-CDC-guidance/)**

**[Bug in iOS 13.3.1 and later keeps VPNs from encrypting traffic, but there’s a simple workaround – 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2020/03/26/bug-in-ios-13-3-1-and-later-keeps-vpns-from-encrypting-traffic-but-theres-a-simple-workaround/)**
