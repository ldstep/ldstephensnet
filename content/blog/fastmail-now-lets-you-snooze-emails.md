Those of you that follow my blog will remember that I [replaced Gmail with Fastmail](https://ldstephens.net/2017/04/17/two-years-of-fastmail-and-how-it-replaced-gmail/) several years ago and have never looked back. Up to now, I have been using Fastmail IMAP in Apple Mail on my Mac, iPhone, and iPad. Now I’m using the official [Fastmail](https://ref.fm/u14726057) app on my iPhone and iPad and Fastmail’s webmail on my MacBook Pro so that I can take advantage of snoozing emails. So far I’m very happy with the Fastmail apps.

As a quick side note, I used [Unite 2](https://www.bzgapps.com/unite) to create a native Fastmail Mac app. This works out really well since Fastmail doesn’t offer an app for Mac.

If you would like to try Fastmail use this [link](https://ref.fm/u14726057) to get a 30 day free trial and a 10% discount for the first year.
