If like me you have more than one iOS device using the same Apple ID you may have noticed that if you download an app on one device the same app will download to the other device. This started happening to me after I got my iPad a few months ago. When I download an app for my iPad it would also download it to my iPhone if it was an app that wasn’t already on my iPhone. Since I don’t always need or want the same apps on both devices I was having to delete apps from my iPhone. Then I discovered that there’s a setting called Automatic Downloads that’s on by default. I went into Settings and turned it off on both devices. Now app downloads only happen on the device I’m using.

Here’s how you do it. Go to **Settings > iTunes & App Store > Automatic Downloads** and toggle the switch next to apps to the off position.
