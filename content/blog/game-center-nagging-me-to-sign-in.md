I’m a big fan of Flow Free. It’s not just a game for me; it’s like a daily workout for my brain, just like I go for a walk or stretch every day for my body. I’ve been on a streak of 2840 days playing it. I also play MobilityWare Solitaire sometimes for the same reason.

However, every time I open either app, I’m greeted with a popup asking me to “Sign in to Game Center,” despite having it turned off. I have no interest in using Game Center, which is why I disabled it. This constant nagging is incredibly frustrating! To make matters worse, Game Center occasionally signs me in automatically, only for me to turn it off again, leading to the same persistent sign-in prompts.

I’ve tried uninstalling Game Center, but that’s not an option. I’ve searched for solutions but haven’t found a way to stop these annoying notifications. Does anyone have any ideas on how to get rid of them?
