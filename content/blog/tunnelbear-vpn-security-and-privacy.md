[TunnelBear](https://www.tunnelbear.com/) was my first and only VPN service. I’ve been using it on my MacBook Pro, iPhone and iPad trouble-free for the last 4 years.

I choose TunnelBear for its simple setup and ease of use as well as it’s [transparency](https://www.tunnelbear.com/blog/tunnelbear-transparency-report-for-2019/) about the data it does and doesn’t collect. Another big plus is that the software has been through [two security audits](https://www.tunnelbear.com/blog/tunnelbear-completes-2nd-annual-independent-security-audit/) by Cure53. All this gives me peace of mind that I can trust the TunnelBear VPN.

If you’re looking for a VPN you should consider TunnelBear.
