So here’s the deal with Ulysses. I’ll not be going with their subscription model. I have a bad taste in my mouth about the way Ulysses handled the move to a subscription and I don’t see the value in paying a subscription to use the app. That said, even though I have 8 free months of use with the new app I decided there is no good reason to continue using it. Now is the time to move on.

Going forward I will be using [iA Writer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id775737590?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude) and [Byword](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude) to write and publish my blog posts. I have both apps and like writing in either.
