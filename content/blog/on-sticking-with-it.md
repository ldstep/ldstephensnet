> Contrary to what many people seem to be doing, especially in the digital world, I don’t often change the tools and services I use. When I find something that works, I’m happy to stick around for the long run.[…] And I can’t really tell you why I find that approach appealing to me. Maybe because it spares me from constantly having to reconsider my choices.[…] I’m writing this blog post using IA Writer, an app I’ve been using since April 2012. That’s more than 13 years ago. And the same story applies to pretty much all the apps I use the most: I’ve been using Sublime Text since 2013, Transmit since 2016, and Codekit since 2014.

I like Manu’s approach of using tools for the long haul. *“And I can’t really tell you why I find that approach appealing to me. Maybe because it spares me from constantly having to reconsider my choices.”*

I struggle with too many choices, especially when it comes to text editors or writing apps, or whatever you want to call them. I’ve used several over the years but never stuck with one consistently. I’d like to change that, but I don’t know the answer. Maybe it’s as simple as picking one app and deleting the rest.
