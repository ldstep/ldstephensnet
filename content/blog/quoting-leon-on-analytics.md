> When I started this blog – 17 years ago! – I installed WordPress’s analytics plugin, which told me how many people were visiting, what they looked at and who was linking to me. I didn’t ask whether I could track this information, and no-one volunteered it. Regardless of whether it was _anonymised_ (yet another grisly marketing term), I was _surveilling_ my readers.

> I ditched analytics quite early in this blog’s history when I realised that knowing about my website visitors had zero effect on anything in the real world. For example, when Smashing Magazine linked to a WordPress theme I’d published I got thousands of visitors over a couple of days. The only practical outcome was that a couple of people approached me to redesign their websites. This would have happened regardless of whether I knew that I’d been linked to, and how many clicks this link had generated.

> The other reason you might put analytics on your site is to know when someone links to your writing. Again, if the linker doesn't intend to tell you, then you're surveilling. You do not _need_ to know every time your writing is mentioned. We should resist the urge to data-fy and commodify our personal websites. Unintuitively, that means smaller, more closed communities and networks where communication is intentional rather than automated and surveilled. You’ll never know everything about your website, or its readers, and nor should you.

We block ads and trackers in our browsers because we don’t want to be watched. But as Leon points out, running analytics on your own site isn’t all that different — it’s still tracking. His reminder is a good one: we don’t need to know who visits, where they came from, or what they clicked. A personal site doesn’t have to be another place where people get surveilled.
