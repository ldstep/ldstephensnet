I’ve been rethinking how I store my digital data. I used to keep it in plain text markdown files. More recently I have been keeping it in apps like [Bear](https://bear.app/), [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/), or Apple Notes. I’ve never been comfortable with this method because of the lock-in. And, use I know Bear and Ulysses have export options.

To get a better idea of how people store their digital data I started a [thread titled “Conflicted! Data storage – Individual files or proprietary database format?” in the MPU forums](https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/conflicted-data-storage-individual-files-or-proprietary-database-format/27260).

What I gleaned from the comments was that more people favored storing data in individual files. Several people use [Devonthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) or [EagleFiler](https://c-command.com/eaglefiler/) while others use a folder structure in Finder. The subject of finding files/search came up. [HoudahSpot](https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/?lang=en) was mentioned a few times as a Finder search app alternative to Spotlight.

Researching HoudahSpot lead me to this [blog post by Brett Terpstra](https://brettterpstra.com/2019/04/04/houdahspot-5-dot-0/).

> For those of us who have shifted from folder hierarchies to search as our primary method of “filing,” Spotlight has become a way of life. And where Spotlight falls short, HoudahSpot steps in and fills the gaps. I’ve said it enough that it sounds cliché to me, but HoudahSpot really is steroids for Spotlight on macOS.

The decision I made was to go back to individual files. All my digital data is now in a shallow folder structure in Finder as individual files. I can access these files with any text editor on any platform. And searching with Alfred or HoudahSpot I can find absolutely any file I’m looking for.
