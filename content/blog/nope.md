**[Apple intros 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros with display notches, M1 Pro, and M1 Max](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/apple-intros-14-and-16-inch-macbook-pros-with-display-notches-m1-pro-and-m1-max/)**

> Nearly a year after announcing the first, low-end M1 Macs last November, Apple has finally unveiled its higher-end Macs. New 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models will include the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, faster successors that build upon the foundation of the original M1, as well as more ports, and a slight redesign. This marks the most significant change to the MacBook Pro since the Touch Bar was introduced back in 2016.

These things are to fucking expensive for a non-pro user. The 14‚Äù starts at $1999 and the 16‚Äù starts at $2499. Sorry Apple, these things are not in my wheelhouse. I‚Äôm happy with my current technology stack. iPhone 11 and iPad Air with Magic Keyboard. That‚Äôs all I need.
