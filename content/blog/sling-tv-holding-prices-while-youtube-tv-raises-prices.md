Yesterday I was reading [M.G. Siegler’s article](https://500ish.com/and-weve-rebundled-d319e701eb49?source=rss----662a29c3b19e---4) about [YouTube TV’s June 30th, 2020 30% price increase](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels). He also speaks to how streaming tv is becoming bundled just like cable tv.

Coincidentally, that same day I got an email from Sling TV telling its users that our price is not going up and that our current price is guaranteed for the next 12 months. After reading Siegler’s article that was good news because I figured Sling might follow in the footsteps of YouTube TV.

If you’re not happy with YouTube TV’s price increase you might want to take a look at Sling. [They’re offering:](https://www.sling.com/whatson/announcements/sling-tv-one-year-price-guarantee?EM=1&utm_medium=email&utm_source=email&utm_campaign=20200630_DOM_ACT_EM_Price-Guarantee_ENG_Smart-Choice_SEND)

> Year Price Guarantee for all new and existing customers. For customers who sign up for SLING TV or who have an existing account by August, 1, 2020 SLING TV will automatically guarantee their current price on any SLING TV service through August 1, 2021 (that’s just $30 per month for SLING Orange or SLING Blue).
