Another one of my favorite apps has gone subscription. This is very disappointing. I refuse to support any more subscription apps. Iâ€™m already on subscription overload. One has to draw the line somewhere.

It does appear that Drafts version 4, which is now called Legacy, will continue to be supported but with no further development. I wonder how long that will last?
