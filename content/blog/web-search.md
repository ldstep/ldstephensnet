Hey friends I don’t know about you, but I’m no longer using Google for search. ChatGPT is just more efficient when I'm looking for answers or doing research.

Depending on what I'm looking for, it can take forever to sift through Google results to find what I need. ChatGPT gives me the right answer 90% of the time. Plus, it's learning about me. For example, it knows I use Netlify to deploy this blog, so when I ask a question about it, I don't have to explain anything, it just knows.

Sure, there are privacy concerns. But Google's been collecting our data for years. I do what I can to protect my privacy, but it's already out there. I get why some folks are wary of AI, but it's not going anywhere. We might as well lean into it.
