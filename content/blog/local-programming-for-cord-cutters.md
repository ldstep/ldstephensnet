One of the problems with cord cutting is getting local programming. When we lived in Southern California we were able to get it using a Mohu HDTV antenna.

One of the limitations of HDTV antennas is that they have an average range of 30 to 65 miles. Living in Central New Jersey now we are too far away from our local market, which is New York City, for an HDTV antenna to pick up the signals. So, we have been without local programming until now.

The other day we got an email from [Sling TV](https://www.sling.com/), to which we subscribe, introducing [Locast](https://www.locast.org/) for local programming. Locast is a new live TV streaming service that offers access to local stations including ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC. Locast recently added support for Roku Players and Roku TV. So, now we can stream local channels for free on our Roku using the Locast Roku Channel.

If youâ€™re interested, Locast local programming is available for free in the following markets.

-   New York
-   Philadelphia
-   Boston
-   Chicago
-   Houston
-   Dallas
-   Denver
