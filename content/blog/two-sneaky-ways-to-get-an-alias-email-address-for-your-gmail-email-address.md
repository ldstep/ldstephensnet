Have you ever wished that you could modify your Gmail email address while still receiving your emails? Well, you can but it’s a bit tricky. There are two solutions you may want to consider. Gmail allows you to create aliases by adding “.” or “+” signs to your email address. For example:

“Append a plus (“+”) sign and any combination of words or numbers after your email address. For example, if your name was hikingfan@gmail.com, you could send mail to hikingfan+friends@gmail.com or hikingfan+mailinglists@gmail.com”.

“Insert one or several dots (“.”) anywhere in your email address. Gmail doesn’t recognize periods as characters in addresses — we just ignore them. For example, you could tell people your address was hikingfan@gmail.com, hiking.fan@gmail.com or hi.kin.g.fan@gmail.com.”

Using Gmail aliases provides several advantages, such as helping you organize your inbox, identify senders, avoid spam and unwanted emails, for testing and sign-ups, and finally protect your primary email address.
