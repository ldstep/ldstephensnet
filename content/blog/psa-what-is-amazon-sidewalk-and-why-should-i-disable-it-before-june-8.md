[Brendan Hesse writing for Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/is-amazon-sidewalk-safe-or-should-you-disable-it-now-1845793859):

> On June 8, Amazon will launch a new feature called Sidewalk that creates small, public internet networks powered by Echo smart speakers and Ring home security products in your neighborhood. Yes, including yours—unless you disable the setting, which is turned on by default. That means if you don’t want your devices included in this particular tech experiment, you only have a week left to opt out.
