Let me tell you why I chose to get my new iPhone 7 Plus from Apple instead of Verizon.

I’ve been a Verizon customer for years. I’ve always taken advantage of Verizon’s new every two plan to upgrade my phone. On January 5, 2017, Verizon eliminated service contracts, smartphone subsidies for existing customers. That meant I would need to go with a payment plan or buy my new phone out right.

I’ve always purchased my Apple products, other than my iPhone, directly from the Apple Store. So in light of Verizon’s changes, I decided to look into getting my next iPhone from Apple instead of Verizon.

In the end, I decided to get my new 32GB iPhone 7 Plus from Apple and here’s why.

### 1\. Pricing

The pricing for my new iPhone 7 Plus from Verizon was $32.08 per month for 24 months. At Apple, it was $37.41 per month for 24 months and that also included Apple Care +. Verizon charges $11.00 per month for their insurance. That makes the phone $43.08 per month at Verizon. So Apple is actually cheaper by $5.67 per month.

### 2\. Unlocked iPhone

My iPhone from Apple is unlocked which means I can use it on any network if I were to decide to leave Verizon for another carrier and it doesn’t have all of Verizon’s bloatware installed.

### 3\. Apple Care +

> Every iPhone comes with one year of hardware repair coverage through its limited warranty and up to 90 days of complimentary support. AppleCare+ for iPhone extends your coverage to two years from the original purchase date of your iPhone1 and adds up to two incidents of accidental damage coverage, each subject to a service fee of $29 for screen damage, or $99 for any other damage, plus applicable tax.2 In addition, you’ll get 24/7 priority access to Apple experts via chat or phone.

### 4\. New phone every year

On Apple’s plan, I’m able to get a new iPhone every year.

> With the iPhone Upgrade Program, you can spread the cost of iPhone over 24 months. But you can also upgrade to a new iPhone after just six months, if you’ve made at least 12 payments. Just trade in your current iPhone and start a new plan. It’s that easy.

With Verizon, you’re locked into 24 months before becoming eligible for an upgrade.

Who wouldn’t rather have a new iPhone every year….?

### 5\. Customer Service

Apple’s customer service was so smooth, the employees so helpful, that an otherwise stressful situation was made pleasurable. My Apple Expert walked me through the plan features and cost and answered all my questions. He helped me backup my old phone to iCloud, signed me up for the Apple payment plan, activated my new iPhone with Verizon and walked me through setting up my new iPhone from my iCloud backup. Once we had my new iPhone setup he walked me through doing a factory reset on my old iPhone. This whole process probably took a total of 2 hours. He stuck with the entire time. The folks in an Apple store are able to help you with ANY question or issue you may be having with an Apple product.

This is so unlike any experience I’ve had at a Verizon Store. If you’ve been to a one you’ll know what I mean.

### 6\. Trade in old device

Apple also offered me the best trade-in for my old 16GB iPhone 6. Better than Verizon. Better than Gazelle.
