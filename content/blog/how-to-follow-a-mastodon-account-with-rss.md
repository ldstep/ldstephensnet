As I recently wrote, “I’m on Twitter with a very narrow use case. I use it to market my blog and posts. I follow app developers of apps that I use to keep up with the latest information about their apps. And last for breaking news. That’s it!”

One of the app developers that I follow on Twitter is developer of [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/). The other day they tweeted that they would no longer be active on Twitter and to follow them on Mastodon.

I don’t plan to open a Mastodon account, so I thought that maybe I could follow a Mastodon account by [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). Well, it turns out that I can. “You can follow any Mastodon account via RSS by just adding “.rss” to the end of the account’s public profile URL.” This is the RSS feed [https://mastodon.social/@bbedit.rss](https://mastodon.social/@bbedit.rss) to follow BBEdit on Mastodon.

As more accounts abandon Twitter for Mastodon, I’ll follow them by RSS in [Reeder](https://www.reederapp.com).
