I like to run my blog posts through Grammarly before publishing to catch spelling and grammar mistakes. However, one thing that bugs me about iA Writer is that it doesn’t work well with Grammarly. It kind of works, but not really. iA Writer won’t accept rephrase suggestions.

Since I’d like to use iA Writer for blog posts, notes, and journaling, I contacted their support team to see if there’s a fix. Here’s what they said:

> Our apps, iA Writer and iA Presenter, do not support Grammarly.

> Grammarly and iA Writer handle user data differently. While we don’t collect any of your information, Grammarly does. Because of this data privacy conflict, we’ve decided not to integrate the Grammarly API.

Not the answer I was hoping for. I’ll figure out a workaround.
