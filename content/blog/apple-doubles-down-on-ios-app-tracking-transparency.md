According to Craig Federighi, The aim of ATT is “to empower our users to decide when or if they want to allow an app to track them in a way that could be shared across other companies’ apps or websites”.

With Apple requiring developers to share privacy details needed for the new privacy labels on December 8 iOS App Tracking Transparency (ATT) has made its way into the news again thanks to the [hysteria of adtech](https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/apple-takes-aim-at-adtech-hysteria-over-ios-app-tracking-change/) and with particular [criticism coming from Facebook-owned WhatsApp](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/09/apple-apps-will-show-privacy-labels/).

> Apple has used a speech to European lawmakers and privacy regulators to come out jabbing at what SVP Craig Federighi described as dramatic, “outlandish” and “false” claims being made by the adtech industry over a forthcoming change to iOS that will give users the ability to decline app tracking.

It’s good to see Apple standing strong on ATT to protect the privacy of its users.
