> Document and share what you’ve built so others can learn from your experiences. My blog has dozens and dozens of blog posts of tools I’ve built and how I run my site.[…] Writing technical blog posts to document your work is such a good move. I go back to my own blog posts regularly to check how to do something. If I’ve done the work of learning from official docs and community forums to solve a problem, I’m in a great position to write it down so I can skip all that the next time.
