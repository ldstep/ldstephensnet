[Apple has launched a service for transferring iCloud Photos and Videos to Google Photos](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/apple-transfer-icloud-photos-google-photos/). Easy data export to a competitor? Hm! “As outlined in an Apple support document, you can go to Apple’s privacy website and sign in to see the “Transfer a copy of your data” option. If you select this and go through all the steps, Apple will transfer your ‌iCloud‌ photos and videos to Google ‌Photos‌.”

“Transferring photos and videos from iCloud Photos does not remove the content you have stored with Apple, but it provides a backup method and stores a copy of the content on Google ‌Photos‌.” Not sure if this is something that I would use. 🤨

On another subject [All of Apple’s 270 U.S. retail stores are open again](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-01/all-u-s-apple-stores-now-open-a-year-after-closures-began) in some capacity for the first time since closures due to the Covid-19 pandemic began nearly a year ago. 👏👏👏

Those of who you have been following me for a while know that I’m a [fan of Fastmail](https://ldstephens.me/two-years-of-fastmail-and-how-it-replaced-gma-840d38bc17b). Here’s [one of the reasons I use Fastmail](https://fastmail.blog/2021/02/26/fastmail-keeps-you-safe-from-spy-pixels/). “Recently, “spy pixels” have been in the news, with the BBC running a story about this marketing industry practice. Fastmail has blocked spy pixels by default for years. Your information is safe with us.”

“Fastmail protects you from spy pixels and other remote images. As the world’s oldest independent email provider, we’ve been defending your privacy for over 20 years.” Take a look at the [Fastmail 30 day Free trial](https://ref.fm/u14726057).

Oh yeah, I got my first of two Moderna COVID-19 vaccinations last Saturday. What a relief.
