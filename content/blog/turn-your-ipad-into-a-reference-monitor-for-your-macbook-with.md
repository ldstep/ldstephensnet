One of the most useful ways I use my iPad is as a reference monitor with my M1 MacBook Air. By using a feature called [Universal Control](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212757), I can extend my MacBook Air’s display to the iPad. This means that I can have two windows open at once, one on each device. This is much more efficient than using the split-screen feature on my MacBook Air.

Universal Control also makes it easy to share content between my MacBook Air and iPad. I can drag and drop files, text, and images between the two devices. This is very useful when I am doing research on my iPad and need to transfer information to a document that I am working on with my MacBook Air.

To set up Universal Control on Mac and iPad, follow these steps:

**On your Mac:**

1.  Choose Apple menu () > System Settings (or System Preferences).
2.  Click Displays.
3.  If using macOS Ventura or later, click the Advanced button at the bottom of the settings window.
4.  Turn on “Allow your pointer and keyboard to move between any nearby Mac or iPad.”
5.  Leave the other Universal Control settings turned on for now.
6.  Click Done.
7.  Next, click Add Display.

**On your iPad:**

1.  Launch the Settings app on your iPad.
2.  Tap General in the sidebar.
3.  Tap AirPlay & Handoff in the menu window.
4.  Toggle on the switch next to Cursor and Keyboard.

Once you have enabled Universal Control on both your Mac and iPad, they will automatically connect to each other when they are within range. Now you can use your cursor and keyboard between devices.
