My favorite podcast is Lance Armstrong’s [The Forward](http://lancearmstrong.com/podcast). I listened to my first episode in July of 2016. At the time, I wasn’t all that impressed and didn’t listen to any more episodes.

When this year’s Tour de France was approaching I was looking for a way to follow the race. I’m a cord cutter so TV was out. I could follow VeloNews on Twitter but that wasn’t the kind of coverage I was looking for. Then I learned Lance Armstrong had a podcast called [Stages](http://lancearmstrong.com/stages).

> Lance Armstrong shares his incisive perspective on the 2017 TDF with a new daily podcast, Stages. Co-hosted by longtime Austin radio personality JB Hager, Stages airs about an hour after each stage finish, from July 1-23.
> 
> The podcast features special guest appearances, insightful course previews and race analysis from Armstrong’s distinct point of view, which takes listeners deep inside the world’s most iconic cycling race. In addition to a daily recap of all the action, Armstrong, who also hosts The Forward podcast, shares anecdotes from his years racing Le Tour.
> 
> Followers can watch this year’s race unfold through the lens of someone who knows the suffering and splendor like no one else.

Stages was what I was looking for. Lance and his co-host JB Hager gave excellent coverage of each stage of the TDF. In fact, it was so good I thought I would check out The Forward podcast again.

I don’t recall which episode of The Forward I listened to first but I came away thinking Lance had become a great interviewer and was interviewing some really interesting people. I’ve since gone back and listened to almost every episode.

> The Forward Podcast with Lance Armstrong gives the audience a rare and revealing listen into Armstrong’s conversations with some of the most interesting people he’s met through the years. Guests of the weekly podcast include an eclectic range of personalities—some well-known, others simply with intriguing stories to tell—from the world of politics, entertainment, art, business, sport and more. The podcast, which often touches on current events, is also a community forum where the audience is encouraged to send questions, comments and any feedback directly to Armstrong. Above all, The Forward Podcast is a personal, honest, engaging and always entertaining dialogue that leaves the listener with new insights and information every week.

I know folks have strong opinions about Lance. Love him or hate him The Forward podcast has some amazing interviews with some great life lessons.

If you like podcasts you should definitely check The Forward out.
