Amidst the controversy over pro writing app [Ulysses](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225570693?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude) moving to a subscription model Shawn Blanc of the [Sweet Setup](https://thesweetsetup.com/) has been working on a course that is designed to help users get the most out of the app. After several months of hard work [Learn Ulysses](https://thesweetsetup.com/ulysses/) is finally available for purchase.

Learn Ulysses is on sale until September 5 for $23 and thereâ€™s also a Learn Ulysses (Basic) course of 5 videos for $19. It also comes with a 30-Day money back guarantee. If you want to become a Ulysses power user, [go check it out](https://thesweetsetup.com/ulysses/).
