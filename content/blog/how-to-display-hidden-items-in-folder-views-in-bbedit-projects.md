The other day I wrote a [post](https://ldstephens.net/blog/why-im-done-with-vs-code/) about ditching VS Code for BBEdit to maintain this site. So, the first thing I did was set up a project in BBEdit for easy access to this site. 

When I opened the project, .files were missing, which meant I couldn't see my .eleventy.js and .gitignore files. What I discovered is that BBEdit hides .files by default, but I couldn't figure out how to make them visible.

I finally gave up and sent a support request. Rich got back to me with this instruction: 

> To display hidden items in folder views in a project, please select the "Everything" option in the menu that appears when you click on the magnifying glass in the area at the bottom of the sidebar.

If you've run into the same problem, I hope this helps.
