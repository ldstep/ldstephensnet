I recently stumbled on [xmit](https://xmit.co) while reading Nicolas Magand’s [About this blog](https://thejollyteapot.com/about) page. I hadn’t heard of it before, so naturally, I got curious and wanted to see what it was all about.  

Turns out, [xmit is an open-source project](https://github.com/xmit-co/xmit.co) created by [Pierre Carrier](https://pcarrier.com) out of Geneva, Switzerland. The idea is simple: host static sites quickly and securely, without a lot of the friction that comes with other platforms.  

Today I decided to put it to the test with another 11ty site that I have `weblog.ldstephens.net`. Setting it up was… well, a little confusing at first. There were a few points where I wasn’t entirely sure what I was supposed to do, and I had to poke around a bit and experiment. But that’s part of the fun. After some trial and error, everything finally clicked, and the site is live.

What I like most so far is how straightforward it feels once you get past the initial learning curve. The builds are impressively fast—xmit only sends new or changed files, so updates are quick and painless. Deploying your site is almost effortless, just one click away.
