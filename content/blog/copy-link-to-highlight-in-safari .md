I can't count the number of times I've wanted a link to a specific section of text in an article. Turns out, Safari can do exactly that. Right-click (or Control-click) any selected text in Safari and choose **"Copy Link to Highlight."** Safari copies a special URL that includes a text fragment. When someone opens the link, the browser scrolls straight to that exact spot and briefly highlights the text you selected.

I just discovered that today, and I'm wondering how I didn't know about it sooner.
