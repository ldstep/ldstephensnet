> Some iPhone and iPad users have reported that battery life is suffering after updating to iOS 14.6 on their device.

My normal practice is to wait a few days before installing OS updates. I want to see if the update is presenting any new issues. I was alerted to a possible battery issue with iOS 14.6 in a [May 26th blog post by Lee Peterson](https://ljpuk.net/2021/05/26/iphone-11-owners-hows-your-battery-life/). Therefore, I did a some research and found that several folks were having problems with rapid battery drain. Iâ€™m going to hold off installing 14.6 and wait for a fix.

As a side note Apple has stopped signing iOS 14.5.1, blocking downgrades from iOS 14.6 [according to 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/01/apple-stops-signing-ios-14-5-1-blocking-downgrades-from-ios-14-6/), so this is no longer a possible workaround.
