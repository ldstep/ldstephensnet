I wanted to share this cool [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) Workflow, [Things for Alfred](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/10769-things-for-alfred-%E2%80%93-interact-with-things-3-using-alfred/?page=2), with you since I know a lot of you have moved to Things 3 since its launch. Hereâ€™s what it does.

Using the keyword todo

-   Use the keyword todo to show Things lists and action any of them for displaying the corresponding to-dos.
-   Action a to-do to display it in the Things UI.
-   Try the modifier keys either in lists or in to-dos for more actions.
