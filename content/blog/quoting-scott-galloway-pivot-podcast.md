> So after the Pope passed, there was something that was attributed to him. I don't know if he said it, but I think it's lovely and I'm going to read it anyways.[â€¦] This life will pass quickly, so do not waste it fighting with people. Do not criticize your body too much. Do not complain excessively. Do not lose sleep over bills. Make sure you hug your loved ones. Do not worry too much about keeping the house spotless. Material goods must be earned by each person. Do not dedicate yourself to accumulating an inheritance. You are waiting for, you are waiting far too much. Christmas Friday next year, when you have money, when love arrives, when everything is perfect. Listen, perfection does not exist. A human being cannot attain it because we are simply not made to be fulfilled here. Here we are given an opportunity to learn. So make the most of this trial of life and do it now. Respect yourself, respect others, walk your own path and let go of the path others have chosen for you. Respect, do not comment, do not judge, do not interfere. Love more, forgive more, embrace more, live more intensely and leave the rest in the hands of the creator.

This is some excellent advice.
