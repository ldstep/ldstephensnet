[Craig Grannell, I Replaced My Mac With an iPad for an Entire Week. It Went as Well as You’d Expect ](https://www.wired.com/story/i-replaced-my-mac-with-an-ipad-for-an-entire-week-it-went-as-well-as-youd-expect/)

> But I quickly find app gaps. There’s no [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/). No [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) for FTP and network storage access—although [FileBrowser](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/filebrowser-documents-manager/id364738545) steps in there. I’m suddenly reminded [Scrivener](https://scrivener.app/) on iPad lacks the Mac version’s two-up page view I use for long-form writing. So I wheel out Apple’s Pages for the first time in forever. (Sorry, Scriv—fix your iPad version and I’ll be back!)[…] Worse, I miss the Mac’s broader customization. [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) is absent. All my custom keyboard shortcuts are gone. As is the Mac-standard Option + up/down arrow to send the cursor to the start/end of a paragraph. My muscle memory is screaming.[…] Lesson of the day: When moving to iPad, make sure your essential apps exist _and_ work, well in advance.[…] To sum up, then: Can you replace your Mac with an iPad? _It depends._ I faced shortcomings. You probably would too.
