I’ve never found a task manager app that worked the way I wanted it to.

My frustration with Fantastical as is task manager is in order to have a task with a due date you have to have a reminder. A lot of times I don’t want or need reminders but I do sometimes want a due date. This led to constantly rescheduling reminders.

In Things, I can create a task with a due date and no reminder or with a reminder. I can also have tasks that I can through in Someday (kind of like a bucket list) or Anytime.

When I used Todoist it never felt right. It was too advanced for my simpler task management needs. I hated seeing unimportant tasks from the day before show up as overdue the next day and then have to reschedule them.

In Things, tasks placed in the Today simply move to the next day when unfinished.​

The Upcoming view lacks the level of detail of Todoist, but I never used those features anyway. All I need is to glance at what’s coming up in the next few days, and that’s what Things 3 provides. Tasks can be easily dragged from one day to another, and each day has its calendar items displayed here as well for a sense of how busy I’ll be.

Things 3 just feels like it’s made for the way I think about tasks.

Check it out. There are [Mac](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904280696?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lude) versions of Things 3 and sync works across all your devices.
