My favorite menu bar manager, ICE, is now compatible with macOS 26 Tahoe. According to the developer, Jordan Baird, this beta release addresses most of the known issues introduced in macOS 26 Tahoe. I’m currently using it on my M4 MacBook Pro and haven’t encountered any problems. You can download the macOS Tahoe beta [here](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/releases/tag/0.11.13-dev.2).
