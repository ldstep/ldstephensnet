A few weeks ago John Gruber [wrote a blog post](https://daringfireball.net/2017/08/safari_should_display_favicons_in_its_tabs) about how Safari should display favicons in tabs. I agree. It would make it so much easier to identify and navigate between open tabs.

Daniel Alm, the developer of [Timing](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timing-automatic-time-tracker/id431511738?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude), thinks so too. This week he released [Faviconographer](https://faviconographer.com/) an app with the single purpose of adding favicons to tabs in Safari for Mac.

I’ve installed the app on my iMac and MacBook and it’s working as expected.

You can learn more about how Faviconographer works and download it [here](https://faviconographer.com/). It’s also free.
