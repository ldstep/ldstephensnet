I’m going to do a 1 year subscription to [Drafts 5](https://getdrafts.com/). Under normal circumstances, I would continue using the free version because that’s all I need. But today the developer posted a tweet with a special offer that I’m interested in.

Now through the end of the day tomorrow, Sept. 18, 2019, all proceeds from new Drafts Pro subscriptions will be donated to support the @\_RelayFM St. Jude Fundraiser. [Details](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/drafts-supporting-relay-fms-st-jude-fundraising/5536):. I’ve been thinking about donating but as of yet I haven’t done so. This is a perfect way to do it. I get Drafts Pro for 12 months and the developer is donating the proceeds of my purchase to the [RelayFM St. Jude Fundraiser](https://www.extras.relay.fm/blog/2019/8/23/relay-fm-for-st-jude). That sounds like a win-win to me.

Thanks to Greg Pierce for this great offer.
