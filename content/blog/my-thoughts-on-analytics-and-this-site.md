Lately, I've been thinking about whether to add analytics to this site. A lot of personal sites use them, and that's totally fine. Back when this site was on WordPress, it had analytics too. But when I moved to 11ty and Netlify, I chose not to add them.

Since the migration, everything I write here has been free from the influence of analytics. No pressure to write what performs. I'm just writing on my own terms, at my own pace. This site is simple and personal and I want to keep it that way.
