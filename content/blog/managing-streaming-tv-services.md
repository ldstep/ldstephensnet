Years ago when we cut the cable cord there were only a few streaming services to choose from. At the time we subscribed to Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and Sling.

Fast forward to today and an overwhelming number of streaming services are available. Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, Amazon Prime Video, Peacock, Paramount+, Disney+, Apple TV+, ESPN+, and the list just keeps going on. It’s all a bit confusing.

We still subscribe to what I call our core services Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and Sling.

As for other services, we only subscribe to watch specific content and cancel the service once we’re done. For example, we recently subscribed to Peacock to watch Yellowstone. And just yesterday we signed up for ESPN + so we can watch the US Open tennis matches. We do the same thing with Apple TV+ and other services.

**Tip**: Sign up for these services through Apple’s App Store or Apple TV platform. This gives you a place to easily subscribe and then unsubscribe.

This switching of services on and off was probably a contributor to Netflix’s loss of a million subscribers in their last quarter.
