> In the beginning, there were blogs, and they were the original social web. We built community. We found our people. We wrote personally. We wrote frequently. We self-policed, and we linked to each other so that newbies could discover new and good blogs.
> 
> I want to go back there.

Me too!

I recently wrote the following in [Medium post](https://medium.com/@ldstephens/some-thoughts-on-where-to-go-as-twitter-flails-7d324e833439) “You’ll notice that I don’t follow individuals on Twitter. Instead, I follow their blog via the RSS feed. I don’t need to follow them on a social media platform. I’m not interested in all the fucking chatter there. The important things that they have to say are posted on their blog. So for all the individuals that you follow on Twitter, you might want to check their profile and see if they have a blog. If they do follow it. It probably has an RSS feed. You can get [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) a free RSS feed reader to follow all the individual blogs you’re interested in. That way you get their most important stuff and none of the chatter.”

I follow close to 100 personal blogs and regularly discover new ones because someone I currently follow linked to a blog that I wasn’t familiar with.

If you don’t have a personal blog now is a good time to start one.
