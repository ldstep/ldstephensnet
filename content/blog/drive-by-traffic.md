Since migrating ldstephens.net from WordPress to 11ty, I was curious to know what _drive-by-traffic_ the site is getting. So I have been running Plausible Analytics on the site for the last 60 days so I would have some idea. Hereâ€™s what I learned:

-  Visitors: 31 per day
-  Page Views: 73 per day
-  Top Sources: Direct and Google
-  Top Countries: US and UK
-  Devices: Mac 50%, iOS 30%, iPadOS 0.1%, other 20%

I got the information I wanted, so there's no need to keep the Plausible subscription. I canceled it. And the stats aren't all that accurate anyway, a bunch of people read via RSS and don't show up in the numbers at all.

I write because I want to share my thoughts, and the exact number of people who read my posts is inconsequential. I'd rather just write and not worry about analytics.
