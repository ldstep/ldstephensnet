I [abandon Gmail](https://ldstephens.net/2017/04/17/two-years-of-fastmail-and-how-it-replaced-gmail/) a few years ago but I’m sure many of you who read my blog are using it. That said, Google [has announced](https://blog.google/products/gmail/making-gmail-on-mobile-better-for-you/) that its mobile apps for iOS and Android are being updated to bring them in line with the design changes and new features that are now available on the web. My last experience with Gmail on mobile was disappointing at best so I’m sure this is welcome news for you Gmail folks.

> This update is part of a larger effort to make G Suite look and act like a family of products, designed in the Google Material Theme with ease-of-use in mind. We’ve already updated the web experiences for Gmail, Drive, Calendar, and most recently Google Docs and Sites. In the coming weeks, you’ll see the new mobile design in Gmail on Android and iOS, with more G Suite mobile apps to follow later this year.
