I’ve been using my M2 iPad Pro as my main computing device for a while now, and I’m really loving it. I’ve figured out how to do most of the things I used to do on my Mac on my iPad, and I’ve even found a few tricks that have made me even more productive.

One of my favorite tricks is using Shortcuts in Slide Over. This lets me have quick access to my most used shortcuts without having to switch apps. I’ve put my clipboard manager app in Slide Over too, so I can easily copy and paste text without having to leave the app I’m working in.

To access Shortcuts in Slide Over, I just press the globe + backslash keys on my keyboard. This brings up a list of my shortcuts, and I can tap on the one I want to run. It’s so quick and easy, and it’s really helped me to streamline my workflow.

If you’re an iPad user, I highly recommend giving this trick a try. It’s a great way to save time and be more productive.

Here are a couple of specific examples of how I use Shortcuts in Slide Over:

-   I have a shortcut that copies the current date and time. This is great for when I need to add a timestamp to a document or email.
-   I have another shortcut that has a list snippets of text that I often use. You could say this is my textexpander for iPadOS.

I’m sure there are many other ways to use Shortcuts in Slide Over. The possibilities are endless!
