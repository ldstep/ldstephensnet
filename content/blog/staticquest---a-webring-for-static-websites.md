> A Webring is a collection of websites that share something in common with each other. In this case, it’s a static site generator website showcase. With 40 members now, at the time of writing, I never thought it would be this popular. I’ve seen quite a few familiar static site generators, and a few new ones. I took some theme ideas from other webrings and tried to keep it simple.

> Listing the members in an easy to read way that also describes their website. The next and previous links, along with a random site link, you can add to your site as well, were really where the fun came in.

Clayton has a clever idea with [Static.Quest](https://static.quest/), so I wanted to joined. It’s another way to get exposure for your site. If you’re interested, you can [join here](https://static.quest/join/).
