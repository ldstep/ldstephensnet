SplashData has published its [annual list](https://www.teamsid.com/worst-passwords-2017-full-list/) of the worst passwords of the year. The data was pulled from over five million passwords that were leaked by hackers in 2017.

Despite many well-publicized data leaks in 2017, it looks like many people are continuing to use weak passwords like “123456” and “password” that are easily guessed by hackers.

If you’re still using weak passwords please, please do your self a favor and stop. Get a password manager. I use 1Password. With 1Password I’m able to have a unique strong password for every website that requires a password and the best part is I don’t have to remember them because 1Password does it for me.

1Password has an app for [Mac](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password/id443987910?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password/id568903335?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lude). LastPass is another option.
