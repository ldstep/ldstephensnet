Yesterday, I was flipping back and forth between Feedbin and iCloud sync in Reeder, still debating whether I could drop my Feedbin subscription, even though I had already [decided to keep it](https://ldstephens.net/blog/update-on-ditching-my-feedbin-subscription/). In the middle of all that, I noticed the “On My iPhone” feed option. I hadn’t really thought about using that before (oops). So I uploaded all my feeds to it and have been using it since. And you know what? It works great. It’s not quite as fast as Feedbin, but it’s fast enough.

One big plus is privacy, since everything’s stored on my iPhone, no service is tracking what I follow or read. That might not work for folks who need their feeds to sync across devices, but I do all my RSS reading on my iPhone, so it’s a perfect fit for me. This means I can finally ditch my Feedbin subscription.
