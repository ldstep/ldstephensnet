> Lately Iâ€™m frustrated with Safari.

> I typically have several Safari windows open, each with a different group of related tabs. When I want to switch to a specific tab itâ€™s a tiny awkward dance of flipping through windows and then CMD-Shift-Backslash to open the Safari tab overview search. Itâ€™s not a great experience, especially if I have a Safari window in another space.

Itâ€™s some clever work that [uses javascript to list all of the browser tabs](https://github.com/epilande/alfred-browser-tabs/blob/main/src/list-tabs-webkit.js). It also has separate triggers to search Chrome, Brave, Edge, and something called Vivaldi.

Alfred Tab Search

I have found this [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) Workflow to be particularly useful when I have lots of tabs and multiple windows open. You can download the workflow here: [https://github.com/epilande/alfred-browser-tabs](https://github.com/epilande/alfred-browser-tabs)
