Most major US Banks offer [Zelle](https://www.zellepay.com/) so I read this article in order to understand how the scam works. After reading it I realized that this scam would be very easy to fall for if you‚Äôre not aware of it. Please take a few minutes to read this article.

> One of the more common ways cybercriminals cash out access to bank accounts involves draining the victim‚Äôs funds via Zelle, a ‚Äúpeer-to-peer‚Äù (P2P) payment service used by many financial institutions that allows customers to quickly send cash to friends and family. Naturally, a great deal of phishing schemes that precede these bank account takeovers begin with a spoofed text message from the target‚Äôs bank warning about a suspicious Zelle transfer. What follows is a deep dive into how this increasingly clever Zelle fraud scam typically works, and what victims can do about it.
