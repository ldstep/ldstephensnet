"Secret service bodyguards have been accused of jeopardising the Swedish prime minister’s safety over several years by sharing details of their running and cycling routes on the fitness app Strava.​[…] Ulf Kristersson’s bodyguards appear to have inadvertently revealed his location, routes and movements – including details of hotels and his private addresses – by uploading their workouts to the app, making them publicly available." [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/08/swedish-pm-safety-strava-data-bodyguards-ulf-kristersson-running-cycling-routes)

I read this today and was surprised by the carelessness. In [Strava](https://www.strava.com), under Settings > Privacy Controls > Map Visibility, there's an option to hide your activity maps from others completely: "*Your map and any data related to your location in future activities will only be visible to you*."

It's surprising that Secret Service bodyguards were even allowed to use Strava, and even more surprising that no one thought to check the privacy settings first.

If you use Strava and care about your privacy, you might want to turn this setting on.
