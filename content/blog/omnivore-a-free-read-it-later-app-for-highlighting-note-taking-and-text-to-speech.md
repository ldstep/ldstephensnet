My long time readers will know that my go-to read-it-later app is [Goodlinks](https://goodlinks.app), but it lacks two features I’d like to see in the future: highlighting with notes and text-to-speech. I’ve stumbled upon a free read-it-later app that offers both these features, and it’s called [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/)!

The text-to-speech quality in most read-it-later apps is subpar. In my experience, the best read-it-later app for text-to-speech is [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.com/). However, Matter is subscription-based and a bit expensive for my budget. So, I was thrilled to discover Omnivore. Its text-to-speech is exceptional.

While I won’t be ditching Goodlinks, I’ll be using Omnivore for listening to articles and for reading articles that require highlighting and note-taking.

Since we’re on the topic of read-it-later apps, [Instapaper has announced a subscription price increase](https://blog.instapaper.com/post/735784644474208256/permanent-archive-and-premium-price-change) effective January 1, 2024.

> We are increasing the price of Instapaper Premium from $3/month ($30/year) to $6/month ($60/year). This will be our first price change to Instapaper Premium in 9 years.
