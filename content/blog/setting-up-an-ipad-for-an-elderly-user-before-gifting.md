I saw this timely article on AppleToolBox today and thought it would be worth sharing. This article is specific to the iPad but it’s also good advice if you’re gifting an iPhone or Mac to an elderly user.

> If you’re purchasing an iPad for an elderly loved one, whether for the holidays or their birthday, one of the best things you can do is set it up before you give it to them. This makes the process of starting to use it much easier for them.
