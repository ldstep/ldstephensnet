> Did you know that Alfred can remember queries you’ve recently typed? Once you’ve enabled this feature, you’ll have access to the latest 20 queries you’ve typed in Alfred by pressing the up arrow. You can even have the most recently typed query automatically populated when you reshow Alfred within 5 minutes.

I just recently discovered this. Good to know!
