> “In exchange for a $6 billion dollar payment from the Sacklers, the arrangement would block future opioid lawsuits targeting them.” The Supreme Court [has temporarily blocked a deal](https://www.npr.org/2023/08/10/1193304383/purdue-scotus-bankruptcy-oxycontin) that would have limited future damages to the family behind the deadly opiate crisis. So this is a good time to refresh your understanding of just how damaging that family business has been. The latest show on the topic is [a Netflix series starring Matthew Broderick and called PainKiller](https://www.netflix.com/browse?jbv=81095069). And some great reads on this topic include: Patrick Radden Keefe’s [Empire of Pain](https://www.amazon.com/Empire-Pain-History-Sackler-Dynasty/dp/0385545681/) (the definitive work on the Sacklers and an amazing history of how drug marketing started and thrives). John Temple’s [American Pain: How a Young Felon and His Ring of Doctors Unleashed America’s Deadliest Drug Epidemic](https://www.amazon.com/American-Pain-Unleashed-Americas-Deadliest-ebook/dp/B01448QLIS/). And Eric Eyre’s [Death in Mud Lick: A Coal Country Fight against the Drug Companies That Delivered the Opioid Epidemic](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Mud-Lick-Companies-Delivered-ebook/dp/B07THF7R53/). Of course, all the content and lawsuits in the world don’t seem to be able to make a dent in the problem.

The Sacklers, dressed to impress in their fancy suits, are  [fucking high-class drug dealers](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/02/politics/what-matters-sackler-opioid-purdue-pharma/index.html). Treat them like any other dealer: charge, convict, and throw ’em behind bars.
