> The complexity bothers me. It’s a lot of moving parts that might not work when [Kirby version 5](https://getkirby.com/releases/5) gets released. Then again, it might work fine, and I’ll have no need to worry. But what about Kirby 6, or 7, or 8? What if Manton  decides to fold Micro.blog (he won't)? What if Justin decides to double the price of Buttondown (unlikely)?

I get it! I'm not a developer either, but this site runs on the static site generator 11ty. It's simple, but I still worry about breaking something I can't fix. Then what?

Funny timing, after reading Kev's post yesterday, I published a couple of posts, and Netlify failed to build the site. What the fuck?

Honestly, that could've been the end of this blog. But I dug into Netlify, found the error logs, and hit a wall of gibberish. As a last resort, I fed it all to ChatGPT, and it actually explained what was wrong and how to fix it in plain English. I know some folks have their ass in a twist about AI, but it saved this blog.

Like Kev, I love tinkering with my site. I'm toying with the idea of moving my notes to **notes.ldstephens.net** and linking out from the main blog. One advantage to doing that is that notes will have their own RSS feed too.

Always something to tweak, break, and (hopefully) fix.
