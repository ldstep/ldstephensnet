## Here’s what you need to know

LastPass is making some changes to LastPass Free that will most likely piss-off users who rely on LastPass as their primary password manager. The big difference is that LastPass Free users will have to choose between mobile or desktop for their unlimited device access, rather than getting the system on both.

**[Here’s What’s Changing](https://blog.lastpass.com/2021/02/changes-to-lastpass-free/)**

> We’re making changes to how Free users access LastPass across device types. LastPass offers access across two device types – **computers** (including all browsers running on desktops and laptops) or **mobile** **devices** (including mobile phones, smart watches, and tablets). Starting March 16th, 2021, LastPass Free will only include access on unlimited devices of one type.

Also

> In addition to this change, as of May 17th, 2021, email support will only be available for Premium and Families customers. LastPass Free users will always have access to our Support Center which has a robust library of self-help resources available 24/7 plus access to our LastPass Community, which is actively monitored by LastPass specialists. 

After March 16th, if you want to use LastPass on desktop and mobile you’ll need a [Premium](https://www.lastpass.com/pricing) account. With this change, you may want to look into a different password manager. [Bitwarden offers a Free account](https://bitwarden.com/pricing/) that you might want to consider.

[Here are the instructions](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/import-from-lastpass/) on how to export your vault from LastPass and import it to Bitwarden.
