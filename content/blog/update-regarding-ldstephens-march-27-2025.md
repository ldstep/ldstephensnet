Hey friends, you may have noticed a flurry of activity here at ldstephens in the last few days. As long-time followers know, this site started on WordPress.com in 2016. Around the time WordPress made changes to the editor forcing users to use the new block editor that I fucking hated I basically stopped posting here.

Over the past several months, I’ve been experimenting with static sites, and I’ve grown particularly fond of the static site generator Eleventy. The other day, I came across an article on [migrating from WordPress to Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/migrate/wordpress/). Using the [11ty/import tool](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/migrate/wordpress/#use-11ty-import), I could import all my content into an Eleventy build. Now, **ldstephens.net** is a static site built with Eleventy, using HTML and CSS, and deployed on Netlify.

The final step: Today, I transferred the domain ldstephens.net from WordPress.com to Hover. I’m now completely free from WordPress.

I’ll be posting here on a regular basis going forward.
