I'd been on the fence about getting a new M4 MacBook for months but kept putting it off. When I finally pulled the trigger, I went with the MacBook Pro over the Air. I got [a great deal](https://ldstephens.net/blog/finally-pulled-the-trigger-m4-macbook-pro-at-300-off/), but more than that, I wanted the larger screen and the XDR display.

**Larger Screen**

The Pro’s 14-inch screen doesn’t sound like a big jump from the Air’s 13.6", but in daily use, it makes a noticeable difference. More room for text, images, and interface elements, and I can scale the resolution for larger text.

**XDR Display**

The Pro’s Liquid Retina XDR display is a big step up from the Air’s standard Retina. It’s brighter and sharper, making everything easier for my old eyes to see. 

All of that means less eye strain and greater clarity, which is great for writing, editing, and reading.

For how I use a Mac, the Pro made more sense.
