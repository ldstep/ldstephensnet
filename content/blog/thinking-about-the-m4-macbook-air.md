Hey friends, I have been thinking about the new M4 MacBook Air. My current Mac is a base model M1 Air that I bought for $999 in October 2022. At the time, I skipped the M2 MacBook Air, which launched a few months earlier at $1,199, because I didn't see the point in spending an extra $200. Most of what I do on a computer is email, web browsing, writing and other things that don’t require much power.

Which brings me to my fucking desire for the new M4 MacBook Air. The question is: just because I can buy it, should I?

Yes, the new Air has the M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and is supposedly "[2x faster](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apple-introduces-the-new-macbook-air-with-the-m4-chip-and-a-sky-blue-color/#:~:text=The%20M4%20chip%20features%20a,up%20to%202x%20faster%20than&text=M4%3A%20Performance%20to%20the%20Next%20Level&When%20compared%20to%20the%20fastest,up%20to%2023x%20faster%20performance)" than the M1 for certain tasks. *But here's the thing, I do undemanding tasks. Even if the M4 is twice as fast, would I even notice? Probably not.* Meanwhile, my M1 Air is in excellent shape. Battery health is at 96%, I've only used 89GB of my 256GB storage, and it runs perfectly fine.

I wrote all this to remind myself that I *don't* need to drop money on a new MacBook Air when my current one more than meets my needs.
