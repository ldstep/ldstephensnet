This morning, I ran into a few issues with the iPadOS 26 beta and had to switch to my MacBook to finish the project I was working on. I don't blame the iPad, it's a beta.

This afternoon, I started writing the blog post about weather apps on my iPad. Even with the new multitasking features in iPadOS 26, I got frustrated and ended up back on my MacBook to finish and publish it. What's still missing on the iPad are all the little automation tools like, Alfred, Keyboard Maestro, and Hazel that make me more efficient on the MacBook but just aren't possible on iPad.
