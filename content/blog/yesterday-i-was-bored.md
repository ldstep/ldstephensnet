Yesterday I was bored and fucking around with site options. I paused ldstephens on Vercel and wandered over to Bearblog, briefly convincing myself I might migrate everything there. I spun up a new site, spent a couple of hours tinkering, even added a subdomain to an existing Bear site thinking, yeah, maybe this is it.

That lasted until this morning. I unpaused ldstephens, put the domain back on Vercel, and shut down everything on Bearblog.

Turns out retired and bored is a great way to end up in rabbit holes that don’t really go anywhere and shouldn't.
