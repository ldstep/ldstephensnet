**Updated June 9, 202**1: [Reeder 5 iCloud feeds sync revisited](https://ldstephens.net/2021/06/09/reeder-5-feed-icloud-sync-revisited/)

> It’s now rock solid! It is so good that I’m leaving Feedly behind. I have had no issues with time-outs and in my opinion sync is just as fast as Feedly.

With [Reeder 5](https://reederapp.com/), the option to sync your RSS feed via iCloud instead of using a third-party sync service such as [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/welcome) or [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) was added.

> Sync all your feeds and articles with iCloud. Reeder 5 comes with a built-in RSS/Feeds service which will keep everything in sync on all your devices. Of course, this is optional. You can still just use one of the many third-party services supported by Reeder

I wanted to try iCloud feed sync thinking I could cancel my free Feedly account. I’ll share a couple of issues that I experienced and ultimately sent me back to using the free version of Feedly. First off I found iCloud feed sync to be much slower than Feedly. In addition to being much slower often times feeds timed out and didn’t sync.
