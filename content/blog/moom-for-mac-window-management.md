The other day, I bought [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) after trying the free trial for about an hour. It’s an amazing Mac app for managing windows. As a side note, I’d tried it several times before but gave up on it because I found getting started confusing.

Before Moom, I was bouncing back a forth between [Better Touch Tool](https://folivora.ai/) and [Magnet](http://magnet.crowdcafe.com/). I wasn’t really happy with either one and was looking for a replacement. This time around I was determined to understand how Moom works. So, after installing it I did a search for getting started with Moom. I came across this video [Wrangle Your Windows with Moom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2M-xDDUOSE) by Kevin Yank that does a great job of explaining how to set up and use it.

If you’re looking for a way to manage windows on your Mac you ought to [download the Moom trial](https://manytricks.com/moom/) and get started by watching Kevin Yank’s video. You’ll be glad you did.
