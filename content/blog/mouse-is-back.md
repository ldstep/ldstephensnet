On June 2nd, I wrote a post about [Missing Mouse](https://ldstephens.net/blog/missing-mouse/). 

> For years, a feral cat (whom we affectionately call Mouse because she kept the mice and rats away from the chicken coop) has come by morning and evening to eat. Her bowl sits on top of the woodpile. Sometimes she'd even hang around during the day. But lately, she hasn't been around, and I think I know why.

A couple of weeks ago, the momma foxes and their pups moved on pretty much right on schedule. Around June or July, the pups get weaned and start learning how to hunt. The whole family starts roaming more, and eventually, they leave the den behind. It's part of how the mom teaches them to survive. Later in the season, the pups head off on their own to find their own territory.

Well, I'm happy to report now that Mouse's competition is gone, she's back. She hasn't missed breakfast or dinner for the entire week. Last night, she even stuck around and took a nap.
