Fifteen years ago yesterday, I was 65 and lying on an operating table at UCLA Medical Center, about to have open heart surgery. Just a few months earlier, in April 2010, I'd been diagnosed with severe mitral valve regurgitation and an enlarged atrium. At the time, I was racing at an elite level as a masterâ€™s cyclist in the U.S. I'd earned plenty of podium finishes in time trials and criteriums, and had just won the California State Masters Criterium Championship for 65+ men. So yeah, hearing I had a serious heart issue came as a shock. 

On July 1, I went in for surgery. What I didn't know at the time (thankfully) was that the 7.5-hour procedure would involve removing my heart to repair the valve and shrink the atrium.

I was incredibly lucky to have Dr. Hillel Laks leading the surgery. He's one of the best, and I'm still here to tell the story because of him. I spent five days in the ICU and a total of seven days in the hospital.

Also grateful to my cardiologists, Dr. Ryland Melford and Dr. Ho Hi Van. They not only gave me excellent care, but they also fought to get my insurance to cover the out-of-network costs so Dr. Laks could do the surgery.

Fifteen years later, I'm still here and grateful every day.
