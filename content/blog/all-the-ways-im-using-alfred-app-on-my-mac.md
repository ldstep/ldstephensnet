If you been following my blog you know I’m a big fan of [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). It does an amazing array of things on my Mac. It’s without a doubt my most used app.

Over the next few weeks, I’ll be writing a series of articles about the ways I’m using Alfred. As a heads up, some of them require the Powerpak.

If you’re new to Alfred the [basic app is free](https://www.alfredapp.com/). The [Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) is $26 US, which I highly recommend. If you would like to follow along go ahead and download the free version now. That way you’ll be ready to follow along when the first article in the series is published.
