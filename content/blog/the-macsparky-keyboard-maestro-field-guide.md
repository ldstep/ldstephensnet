Keyboard Maestro is one of my most used Mac apps. In fact, I’ve written several articles about how I use it here on this blog.

Here are a few of those articles:

[Keyboard Maestro Macro – Getting URLs from Safari](http://ldstephens.net/2017/04/26/keyboard-maestro-macro-getting-urls-from-safari/)  
[Keyboard Maestro macro for plain-text pasting anywhere](http://ldstephens.net/2017/05/28/keyboard-maestro-macro-for-plain-text-pasting-anywhere/)  
[Launch your favorite Mac apps with keyboard shortcuts | Keyboard Maestro](http://ldstephens.net/2017/06/20/launch-your-favorite-apps-with-keyboard-shortcuts-keyboard-maestro/)  
[Quickly quit all open applications at once on your Mac – Keyboard Maestro](http://ldstephens.net/2017/08/24/tip-quickly-quit-all-open-applications-at-once-on-your-mac-keyboard-maestro/)

If you’ve been thinking about getting Keyboard Maestro now would be a great time. Here’s why. David Sparks has just released his [MacSparky Keyboard Maestro Field Guide](https://learn.macsparky.com/p/km). This is a great way to get started. There are over 4 hours of streaming or downloadable video, 76 separate videos, 8 separate sections, many downloadable Keyboard Maestro scripts, and lots of knowledge, tricks, and hacks to make your Mac dance.

David is offering an [introductory price of $24 for a limited time.](https://learn.macsparky.com/p/km) Along with the introductory price for the Field Guide the developer is also offering a limited time 20% discount for the Keyboard Maestro application.

> If you don’t have the Keyboard Maestro application yet, no problem. Keyboard Maestro’s developer digs the new Field Guide so much that he is giving 20% off the purchase of the Keyboard Maestro app for a limited time to celebrate the release of the new Field Guide. Just use the **offer code “KMFG”** when [purchasing the Keyboard Maestro application](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/).
