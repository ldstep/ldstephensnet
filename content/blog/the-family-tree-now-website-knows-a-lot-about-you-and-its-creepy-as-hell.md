A couple of weeks ago I saw a segment on the NBC Today Show about a website called [Family Tree Now](http://www.familytreenow.com/). I’d never heard of it. But it knew a lot about me.

Family Tree Now is a genealogy website that can be used to lookup almost anyone’s personal information. Addresses, family members, and known associates are free for anyone to find.

Check it out for yourself [here](http://www.familytreenow.com/). If you’re surprised at what you see you’ll most likely want to opt-out like I did.

Here’s how. Patrick Allen, [writing for Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-opt-out-of-the-most-popular-people-search-sites-1791536533), offered up information on how to opt-out from Family Tree Now, Whitepages, Spokeo, and other popular free people search engines just like it. You’ll find his article [here](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-opt-out-of-the-most-popular-people-search-sites-1791536533).
