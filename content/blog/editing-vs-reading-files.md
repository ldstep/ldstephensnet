I recently realized something simple but helpful. When I want to open a file, I’ve got two options.

In the past, I always opened everything in a text editor no matter what I was doing. But now I think of it like this:

1. If I want to edit a file, I open it in [MarkEdit](https://markedit.app).
2. If I just want to read a file, I open it in [Marked 2](https://marked2app.com).

It’s a small change, but it’s made working with Markdown files a bit smoother. Right tool for the right task.
