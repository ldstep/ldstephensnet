If you use [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) for capturing ideas and [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) for managing your to-dos, did you know you can utilize Things [Quick Entry with Autofill](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2249437/?platform=quick%20entry%20with%20autofill#ggsxa) directly in Drafts? The default keyboard shortcut to activate Things' Quick Entry with Autofill is ⌃+⌥+⌘+space. This will capture the first line of the open document as the title and include the Drafts URL in the notes section.

This feature is particularly useful when you're working on something in Drafts and want to be reminded about it later in Things.
