I’m trying out a new Mac app on the [recommendation of MacOSX Guru](https://bicycleforyourmind.com/antinote_a_beautiful_scratchpad). [Antinote](https://antinote.io/) is a scratchpad for quick, temporary notes. I’ve been using Tot for this kind of thing, and I rely on Drafts for other capture. But Antinote looks interesting, so I’m giving it a try with the seven-day free trial.

> I love Antinote. I think it is an useful addition to my workflow. It has a lot of competition in the scratchpad space, but it is unique in that space. It does what it sets out to do well and adds some features which are not usually supported by this category of applications. It’s priced well and is supported by the developer.
