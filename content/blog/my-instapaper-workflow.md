Awhile back [I wrote](https://ldstephens.net/2017/05/01/moving-read-later-to-pinboard-no-more-pocket-no-more-instapaper/) that I was ditching [Instapaper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lude) and [Pocket](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-save-articles-videos/id309601447?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lude) and using [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) for reading later. As it turned out, there was a flaw with that.

Here’s what was missing from Pinboard. The ability to highlight text and add notes as I’m reading.

I read a lot. Reading is where I get the inspiration for many of the articles I write. So Instapaper is part of my blogging workflow. Here’s how it works.

I collect everything I want to read in Instapaper. Once in Instapaper, I highlight things that catch my attention and add notes as I’m reading. If after reading an article I want to comment on it in a blog post or it gives me inspiration for a new article I go to the bottom of the article in iOS and tap Share All Notes. This exports all my highlights and notes to the iOS share sheet. From the iOS share sheet, I send the export to Drafts for delivery to my Writing In Progress folder in Dropbox. Now I can open the file in Byword, BBEdit or iA Writer for editing on my Mac.
