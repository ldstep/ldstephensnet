[Bear](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear-beautiful-writing-app/id1091189122?mt=12&at=1000lude) has several special searches that I find useful.

The other day I imported a large number of files without tags into Bear. Once imported I did a @untagged search to find them and then added the proper tag(s). This saved a lot of time. I also do a @untagged search every week or so to find notes that I’ve added and forgot to tag.

I also use @task, @todo, and @done to manage tasks. You can see the definition of what each one does below.

Here’s a list of all Bears special searches:

-   **@tagged** : shows the notes which have at least one tag
-   **@untagged**: shows the notes without tags
-   **@today**: show the notes modified the current day
-   **@yesterday**: show the notes modified the day before the current
-   **@images**: shows the notes which contain images
-   **@files**: shows the notes which contain files
-   **@attachments**: shows the notes with files or images
-   **@task**: shows the notes which include at least one todo element, either complete or not
-   **@todo**: shows only the notes with not completed todos
-   **@done**: shows only the notes with all the todos completed
-   **@code**: shows the notes which includes at least one code
