Hey friends, as you know, I [installed the developer beta](https://ldstephens.net/blog/more-thoughts-on-ipados-26/) on my 11” iPad Air to explore the new windowing option, but I was disappointed to find that Slide Over and Split View had been removed from the Full Screen Apps option.

The current windowing option is frustrating on the 11” iPad. I have never liked Stage Manager, and without Slide Over and Split View in the Full Screen Apps, the iPad has become nearly unusable for me.

In my opinion, Apple made a mistake with iPadOS 26 by not including Split View and Slide Over in the Full Screen Apps option. I prefer these features over Stage Manager and the new Windowed Apps setup.

At the end of the day, I’m Mac-first and only use the iPad occasionally, but losing Split View and Slide Over makes me even less likely to reach for it.
