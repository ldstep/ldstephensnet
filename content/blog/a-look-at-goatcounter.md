I discovered [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/), an open-source analytics platform by developer [Martin Tournoij](https://github.com/arp242) while digging through the colophon on someone’s website. I wish I could remember whose, but I don’t.

GoatCounter is free and made for personal sites. According to Martin, it _“aims to offer easy-to-use and meaningful privacy-friendly web analytics.”_

There are plenty of opinions about whether personal websites need analytics at all. I’ve gone back and forth over the years. But after reading Martin’s post, [Analytics on personal websites](https://www.arp242.net/personal-analytics.html), I decided to give GoatCounter a try. It was simple to set up and just works.

One caveat: it only captures drive-by traffic. So you’re not seeing hits blocked by ad blockers or RSS feed readers. If you’ve been on the fence about adding analytics to your site, GoatCounter is worth a look.
