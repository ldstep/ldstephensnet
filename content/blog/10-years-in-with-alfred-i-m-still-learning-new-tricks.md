I've been listening to the Mac Power Users podcast since I got my first Mac, a 2015 MacBook Pro. MPU was my introduction to automating my Mac, and [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) was one of the first automation apps that I installed.

This week’s [episode](https://www.relay.fm/mpu/796) of MPU was all about Alfred. I almost skipped it, thinking it would be a waste of time. I mean, what could I possibly learn after using Alfred for 10 years?

Well, I learned a couple of things. First, David talked about how he rarely uses the Finder anymore. He does everything in Alfred. I already use Alfred to launch files and folders, but I didn't realize I could process what I wanted to do with the file or folder using Universal Actions.

I also found out that the Alfred Workflow Gallery now has several hundred workflows. One that stood out is called [Link Clean](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/link-clean-workflow/). It removes tracking parameters, mobile subdomains, and other shit from URLs. Perfect for cleaning up those messy Amazon links.

If you’re new to Alfred or an old timer like me, give it a listen. Alfred is free with a paid option for additional features. During the podcast, MacSparky announced the new [Alfred Field Guide](https://learn.macsparky.com/p/alfred-5) available now.
