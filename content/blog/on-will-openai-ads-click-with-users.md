> Can they take their existing model and layer in advertising, versus it consuming the entire product, ensuring "[enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification?ref=spyglass.org)"?[…] But again, the key will be finding the right mix of where/when to serve ads and what type of ads to serve. Oh, that's all? The company is confident enough to think that the business will [bring in "low billions" this year](https://www.ft.com/content/ec1656cd-e07b-48ed-92a8-26c7fe517899?utm_sf_post_ref=652820930&utm_sf_cserv_ref=10977192&ref=spyglass.org), but can they do that without ruining the product experience? I think it's going to take thinking differently about ads.

I'm genuinely concerned about how the introduction of ads will impact my ChatGPT experience.

As someone who goes to great lengths to avoid advertising, using uBlock Origin on my MacBook and Wipr on my iPhone I rarely see a single ad. I've almost forgotten what the cluttered version of the web even looks like.

That's why I'm rethinking how I'll use ChatGPT. Instead of the dedicated ChatGPT app, where I have little control over the content, I plan to use the browser version. My logic is: by staying within the browser, I can let my ad blocker keep the interface clean.

I'll be watching to see how intrusive these ads actually become.
