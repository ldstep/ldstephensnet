Back in my PC days, Firefox was my browser of choice. So when I moved to the Mac I installed Firefox because that was what I was used to. After a month or so of using Firefox, I tried Safari and have never looked back until today.

I noticed a couple of articles about [Firefox Quantum](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/) in my newsfeed yesterday. I thought I would check it out.

Here’s my quick takeaway:

It’s fast. Really fast! The speed increase comes from the completely overhauled core engine with new technology. I like the new look and feel. But I’m most impressed with how fast it is.

I’m going to run it as my default browser for a few days as a test. I doubt that it can replace Safari. It will definitely replace Chrome as my backup browser though.

If you’re already a Firefox user you should receive an automatic update otherwise you can download it [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

MacRumors has a good review of Firefox Quantum for Mac which you can read [here](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/14/mozilla-releases-firefox-57-quantum-web-browser/).
