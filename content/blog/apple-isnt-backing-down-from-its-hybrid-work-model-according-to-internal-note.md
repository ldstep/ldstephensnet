[Zoe Schiffer writing for The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556615/apple-response-hybrid-work-model-employee-letter-remote):

> Apple isn’t backing down from its hybrid work model that will require most employees to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Fully remote positions will be extremely limited.

> We believe that in-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future,” said Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, in a video recording viewed by The Verge. “If we take a moment to reflect on our unbelievable product launches this past year, the products and the launch execution were built upon the base of years of work that we did when we were all together in-person.”

\[…\]

> In the wake of that announcement, Apple employees wrote a letter saying some employees had been forced to quit because of the policy, and asking Cook to change his stance. They asked that all teams be given the option to work remotely, noting “without the inclusivity that flexibility brings, many of us feel we have to choose between either a combination of our families, our well-being, and being empowered to do our best work, or being a part of Apple.”

> Now, Apple is essentially denying that request, saying any remote work decisions will be made “on a case-by-case basis with any new remote positions requiring executive approval.”

The position that Apple is taking on this is turning out to be controversial. If you’re interested in this sort of thing, here are a couple of interesting takes on the subject. A post written by [John Gruber on Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/04/apple-remote-work) and a post written by [Charlie Warzel on Galaxy Brain](https://warzel.substack.com/p/this-is-the-awful-voice-inside-my). Gruber sides with Apple and Warzel takes exception to that.
