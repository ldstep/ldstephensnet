Do you know what one of the hardest things to do is? To not be switching apps all the time. Especially writing, todo, and notes apps. Switching to the latest new shiny thing is unproductive and can be expensive.

Here’s an interesting thread about the subject over on Talk – Mac Power Users:

[Resolving to not switch apps](https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/resolving-to-not-switch-apps/14164)

For 2021 I’m sticking with the apps that I wrote about in my 2021 Essential Apps articles. No more switching!
