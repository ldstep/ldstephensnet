One complaint I and many others have had with Safari was the lack of Favicons in tabs. Well, with Safari 12 on Mac and iOS complain no more.

**To enable Favicons on tabs in macOS:**  
First off you will need to have updated to Safari 12 and be running either Sierra or High Sierra. Now open Safari and go to **Preferences > Tabs > Show website icons** and check the box.

**To enable Favicons on tabs in iOS:**  
First off you will need to running iOS 12. Now open Settings and go to **Safari > Show icons in tabs** and turn it on.
