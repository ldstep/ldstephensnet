Safari is my default browser. The Alfred feature I’m going to tell you about works with what ever browser you have set as your default. You’ll also need the Powerpack.

I launch all my bookmarks using [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). Alfred recognizes URLs when I type them into the Alfred box so I can launch a website in Safari from anywhere. Once I’ve typed a URL Alfred remembers it in a history.

Now the next time I want to launch a bookmark that’s in my history all I have to do is start typing in the Alfred box. For example, if I want to go to the Mac Stories website I can type “mac” in Alfred box and hit ⌘3. As you can see the macdrifter and macsparky URLs also appeared.

This saves me several mouse clicks over using bookmarks in Safari. And remember, you can launch a bookmark this way from anywhere.

This feature can be enabled under Features > Web Search > URLs/History.
