I love the Mac. It’s my preferred computing device. What makes the Mac great are all the apps that increase productivity. I’m thinking about [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/), [PopClip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/), [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/), and [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/) to name a few. You won’t find these in iOS or iPadOS

So, my Mac’s are getting old. Up to today, I have been concerned with what I would replace them when the time comes?

If you care about the Mac as I do you’ll want to read Marco Arment’s article [Apple is Listening](https://marco.org/2019/06/09/apple-is-listening). After WWDC and reading Marco’s article I’m encouraged about the future of the Mac and that I will be able to continue to enjoy the Mac and the apps that I love using.
