> Back in 2018 I decided I was ditching Android for an iPhone. Since then my Apple devices have continued to grow. Have I become a fanboy? I recently bought my seventh Apple device to add to my ever growing collection of iStuff. Here’s what I currently own:

This reminds me of my iCreep journey. Only mine started back in December 2014 when the keyboard on my Android went to hell. I replace it with a refurbished iPhone 6 Plus from Verizon.

Next came an iMac to replace my Windows computer. In 2015 I decided it would be nice to have MacBook so I got a MacBook Pro. I loved it so much that I finally sold the 2013 iMac.

I was never interested in an iPad but I eventually got one. It was the cheapest base model and as it turned out I never used it all that much.

Today I’m all in with Apple devices.

-   iPhone 11
-   M1 iMac
-   iPad Air
-   Magic Keyboard for iPad
-   Apple Pencil
-   Apple Watch
-   Air Pods Pro

I wouldn’t call myself a “fanboy” but I love my Apple products.
