Hey friends,

I’ve been using Instapaper version 8.4 since it was released last week and I’m really loving it. It’s a great way to save articles and read them later, and the new interface is really clean and easy to use.

If you’re looking for a great way to save and read articles, I highly recommend Instapaper. It’s free to sign up, so give it a try!
