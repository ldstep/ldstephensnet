This site started on Netlify's Free plan back in November 2024. In May 2025, I added analytics, and when I entered my credit card information, I was upgraded to the Starter plan. After Netlify transitioned to the new credit-based system, that plan became the legacy Starter plan.

Yesterday, I removed my credit card because I don't plan to use any paid features. To do this, I first had to downgrade to the Free plan. I expected to revert to my original, now-legacy Free plan, but instead, I was switched to the new credit-based Free plan.

On the legacy plan, I was comfortably under the limits for bandwidth, builds, and web requests. However, after calculating my usage on the new plan, I realized I'd burn through my monthly credits by about the halfway point. Once you run out of credits, your site shuts down until the next cycle, which is not a situation I can accept.

As a result, I moved the site to Vercel's Free (Hobby) plan, where I am well under the limits for bandwidth and edge requests.
