Hey friends, I’ve been bouncing between Things 3 and GoodTask with Reminders as the back-end for a few years. Lately, I've been using Things. But yesterday, I was bored[^That happens when you're retired.], so I decided to brush off GoodTask and start using it again[^Someday, Things 4 is going to come and I won’t want to spend the money for the upgrade or possible subscription.].

The only problem? I have GoodTask on my iPhone and iPad, but not on my MacBook. I've tried the Mac trial, but I don't like it. Plus, it’s a $40 purchase that I don't want to make. I dislike the Reminders app even more. So I needed a way to access Reminders on my Mac.

Turns out, I can view and add Reminders using Raycast plugins, so I don't need a dedicated app on my MacBook. But during this process, I stumbled on a new menubar utility that's pretty cool: [Reminders MenuBar](https://github.com/DamascenoRafael/reminders-menubar). It's easy to access with a keyboard shortcut, making it super convenient. If you use Reminders, you might want to check it out.

I still haven’t decided which way I’m going to go. For now, I running both options side by side.
