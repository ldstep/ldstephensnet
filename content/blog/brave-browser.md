I recently [wrote about my disappointment](https://ldstepblog.wordpress.com/2019/07/07/safari-13-will-no-longer-work-for-customers-using-1password-6/) that 1Password 6 isn’t going to work with Safari 13.

In Safari 13, the Safari Extensions Gallery is being replaced with Safari App Extensions. What that means is that Safari App Extensions must run through native Mac apps and will only be available through the Mac App Store. [Extensions from Extension Gallery](https://developer.apple.com/safari/extensions/) will stop working.

That means that my favorite privacy extension uBlock Origin along with other extensions will also stop working in Safari 13. I have a feeling that Safari 13 will have a lot of folks looking for a new browser. I’m one of them.

Based on lots of positive comments in the [MPU forum](https://talk.macpowerusers.com/) I’m now experimenting with [Brave](https://brave.com/) privacy browser. Since it’s open-source and based on Chromium all the extension in the Chrome Web Store will work with it. I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks and so far I’m very pleased.

By the way, the 1Password 6 extension doesn’t work with the current version of Brave browser. You’ll have to upgrade to version 7 or switch to a different password manager. As I mentioned before I’m in the process of switching over to [Enpass 6](https://www.enpass.io/). If you’re interested you can read about it [here](https://www.enpass.io/blog/announcement/introducing-enpass-6-crafted-with-the-spirit-of-himalayas/).
