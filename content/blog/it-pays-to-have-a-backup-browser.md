On Friday, I was working in Safari on my MacBook and needed to sign in to a few accounts. I discovered nothing would log in. Bitwarden’s latest update had broken the Safari extension, leaving me with an endless loading spinner.

Good thing I keep Firefox around. I switched over, signed in, and finished what I needed to do. If I hadn’t had a second browser installed, I’d still be waiting for Bitwarden to ship a fix.

Moments like this are a good reminder: having a backup browser costs nothing, takes almost no effort, and can save you when something small decides to break.

PS: Bitwarden has since released a fix.
