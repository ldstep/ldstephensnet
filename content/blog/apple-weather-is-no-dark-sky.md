Before Apple Weather transitioning to WeatherKit, I used both Apple Weather and Dark Sky. I used Apple Weather for long range 10-day forecasts because the Weather Channel (Apple’s weather source) is the most accurate for my area. I used Dark Sky for its hyper-local weather that offered accurate next-hour precipitation warnings, notifications for snow accumulation, alerts for high winds and severe weather, and custom notifications. Since Dark Sky App support ends December 31, 2022, and Dark Sky API support ends March 31, 2023, I have been searching for a replacement for this combo.

I’ve tried Apple’s new Weather app with Dark Sky forecast data, and it just isn’t in the same league as the Dark Sky before Apple’s acquisition. Apple Weather is no Dark Sky. I miss Dark Sky’s expanding daily detail, notifications, alerts, and hyper-local weather accuracy.

For now, I’m using [Carrot Weather](https://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/). What I like about it is that I can choose from multiple weather sources. What I don’t like about it is that the notifications and alerts aren’t as good as Dark Sky.

Apple should have renamed Dark Sky Apple Weather and let it be the standard weather app. But no, they’re trashing Dark Sky and giving us Weather app instead.
