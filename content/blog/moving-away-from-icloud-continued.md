Previously I made the following changes:

-   [Moved from Notes back Bear](http://ldstephens.net/2019/10/31/im-done-with-apples-notes/)
-   [Moved from iCloud back to Dropbox](http://ldstephens.net/2019/11/03/back-to-dropbox-after-a-short-stint-with-icloud-drive/)
-   [Moved from iCloud to Dropbox for Ulysses sync](http://ldstephens.net/2019/11/09/store-ulysses-files-in-dropbox-instead-of-icloud/)

Since then I’ve made a couple of additional changes:

-   Moved from iCloud Calendars to [Fastmail Calendars](https://ref.fm/u14726057)
-   Moved from Apple Reminders to [Due](https://www.dueapp.com) with Dropbox sync

As a side note, you may be wondering why I’m still using Bear since it uses iCloud for sync? Well, I’ve never once had a sync issue with it. It just always works in spite of all the other issues I’ve had with iCloud sync.
