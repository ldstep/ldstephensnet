I broke my rule of waiting a few days before updating to a new OS on my iPhone. I went ahead and installed iOS 12 on it and my iPad this morning. I figured I would be safe based on everything I’ve heard from those who have been running the beta and so far everything is working fine.

To get up to speed I’m working my way through [Federico Viticci’s MacStories iOS 12 review](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-12-the-macstories-review/#introduction). It is well written and illustrated. I highly recommend it. Give it ago because there are some nice new features like Screen Time and Shortcuts that you’re going to want to learn how to use.
