In 2024, the iPad Pro is rumored to receive it’s first major update since 2018, [according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-08-27/ipad-pro-2024-magic-keyboard-redesigned-tablet-m3-september-12-event-details-lltgk6fv). However, this “major overhaul” doesn’t seem that major to me. Here’s what’s expected:

-  Introduction of the M3 chip.
-  Slight screen size bump from 12.9 inches to 13 inches.
-  A new Magic Keyboard with a larger trackpad.
-  OLED screen.

Overall, I’m not feeling the urge to upgrade my iPad Pro in 2024. How about you?
