The other day, I read two reviews about [OmniOutliner 3](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnioutliner-3/id1174101450?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lude). As I read them I got to thinking. Maybe outlining could help me better organize my thoughts for what I want to write.

My current method of organizing my thoughts is a bit messy. I have a basic idea of what I want to write and I start writing. This doesn’t always work out so well. It’s frustrating at times. I know what I want to say but I don’t know how to say it in an organized way.

I’ve tried mind-mapping with [MindNode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mindnode-5/id1289197285?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude) but mind-mapping doesn’t click for me. So, I’m going to try using outlines. I’m giving two apps a try. [OmniOutliner 5](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnioutliner-5/id1142578772?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude) Essentials and [OutlineEdit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outlineedit-beautiful-outliner/id878995413?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude). OmniOutliner 5 Essentials has a free 14 day trial with an in app purchase of $9.99. OutlineEdit is free on the App Store.
