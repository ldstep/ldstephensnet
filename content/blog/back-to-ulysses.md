This is probably stupid, but I installed [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app) as my blog post editor today. It used to be my go-to for years until I canceled my subscription and moved on. I think that was around March 2019, when [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) finally came to the Mac and I switched over.  

If you’ve been following this site for a while, you know I’ve been switching text editors about as often as I change my underwear recently and honestly, I’m getting fucking tired of it. I want one editor and I want to stick with it.  

What I like about Ulysses is that it’s a dedicated writing app with a proper folder structure instead of tags. It’s customizable, so I can set my preferred font and theme, and once it’s set up, it’s a simple, distraction-free writing environment.  

This site is built with 11ty, so Ulysses works great with its Markdown and HTML exports.  

My writing needs are pretty simple, and Ulysses has a bunch of features I’ll probably never use but that’s fine. It does what I need, and that’s what matters.
