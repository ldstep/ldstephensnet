My favorite RSS Reader is now Free.

A [tweet from reederapp says](https://twitter.com/reederapp/status/1034821640864129026):

> Reeder is free until version 4 is released later this year as a paid upgrade. No subscription.

I have been using [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) for several years. In my opinion there is none better. It’s Free so give it a try. You’ll also want to check out Reeder 4 when it’s released.
