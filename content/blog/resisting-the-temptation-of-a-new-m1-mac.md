I’m starting my 7th month of being iPad only. It is working out amazingly well. But with all the new M1 Macs, I’m being severally tempted to trade in my 2015 MacBook Pro for one of the new M1 Macs of undetermined configuration. If I do this, I’ll want to switch back to a Mac as my main computing device.

Not helping this situation is all the Apple influencers talking about their M1 Macs on their podcasts over the last several months. Especially when you hear some die hard iPad folks getting them.

Of course, the right thing to do is to wait for the rumored 2022 MacBook Air refresh, since a MacBook Air is what I would likely get. As [I wrote the other day,](https://ldstephens.net/2021/10/19/nope/) the Pros are to damned expensive for my use case.

Most importantly I shouldn’t forget why I left a Mac for an iPad in the first place.
