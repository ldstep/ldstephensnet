My title for this post is a bit misleading. But stick with me. iOS and iPadOS donâ€™t have a dictionary like on macOS. To add a word to the dictionary on macOS you select the word you want to add to the dictionary right click on and select learn. From then on the word will no longer get flagged as misspelled.

On iOS and iPadOS, the built-in dictionary doesn't learn new words like on the Mac. But you can teach the system to stop flagging words you use often as misspelled. Here's how:

1. Go to Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement.
2. Tap the + button.
3. In Phrase, enter your word.
4. Leave the Shortcut blank (unless you want one).
5. Tap Save.

This forces the system to treat it as a valid word.
