I’m sure you’ve already read or heard about the latest Facebook hack involving the personal information of at least 50 million users. The hack was revealed in a [Facebook blog post](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/09/security-update/) yesterday. If you haven’t here are the details.

Mike Isaac and Sheera Frenkel, [writing for the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/technology/facebook-hack-data-breach.html)

> Facebook, already facing scrutiny over how it handles the private information of its users, said on Friday that an attack on its computer network had exposed the personal information of nearly 50 million users.

[According to TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/28/facebook-hack-instagram-facebook-login/), Instagram and other third-party sites that use Facebook Login may not be out of the woods either.

> In a follow-up call on Friday’s revelation that Facebook has suffered a security breach affecting at least 50 million accounts, the company clarified that Instagram users were not out of the woods — nor were any other third-party services that utilized Facebook Login. Facebook Login is the tool that allows users to sign in with a Facebook account instead of traditional login credentials and many users choose it as a convenient way to sign into a variety of apps and services.

As I’ve written before, now is a good time to delete your Facebook account. Between getting hacked and selling your personal data for advertising purposes Zuckerberg and his gang just can’t be trusted.
