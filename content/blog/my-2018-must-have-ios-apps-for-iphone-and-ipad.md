[My Must-Have Mac and iPhone Apps for 2017](https://ldstephens.net/2017/01/04/my-must-have-mac-and-iphone-apps-web-services-for-2017/) was one of my most popular posts. In making this a tradition I’m sharing my 2018 must have apps in hopes you’ll discover a new app or two that will improve your workflow or make you more productive.

During 2017 I tried a lot of different apps. Some I liked and switched to, others I tried and didn’t like and stayed with what I’d been using. Having the right app for the right task on the right device is key to my productivity.

You can find **[My 2018 Must-Have Mac Apps here](https://ldstephens.net/2017/12/26/my-2018-must-have-mac-apps/)**.

## My iPhone and iPad setup:

My iPhone is a 32 GB Silver 7 Plus. It’s my first plus size iPhone and I love it.

My iPad is a 2017 9.7” with Retina display with 128 GB of storage. It’s used primarily for reading, email, checking Twitter, web browsing, and occasionally for writing.

### Here’s my software and what I use it for:

**Safari  
**Safari is my browser on iOS.

**Mail.app  
**[Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=14726057) IMAP works flawlessly with the stock mail.app.

**Messages  
**Messages is for messaging with my friends and family.

**[Things 3](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lude)  
**Things 3 is for task management and reminders. I love the simplicity of how it works. I wrote an article about it [here](https://ldstephens.net/2017/10/17/things-3-for-personal-task-management/).

**[Fantastical 2  
](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2-for-iphone-calendar/id718043190?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lude)**Fantastical is my calendar app. It’s where I keep all my appointments and some reminders.

I’ve written about how I use Drafts [here](https://ldstephens.net/2017/03/31/getting-drafts-right/).

During the year I tried other writing apps but none compares with Ulysses. I do most all my writing on my Mac so it’s rarely used on my iPhone and iPad other than for a quick add to one of my stores or for the share sheet.
