Hey friends, a part of getting older is having the time to reflect on some of the things you’ve accomplished in this life. The other day, I was reminiscing about my accomplishments on the bike and thought I’d share them with you.

From 2003 to 2010, cycling was a huge part of my life. I wasn’t just riding for fun; I was training, pushing, and chasing something. I got faster, stronger, and more disciplined. In 2005, I hit a milestone I’m still proud of: the [California Triple Crown](https://www.caltriplecrown.org/DoublesbyName/RiderHistoryReport.asp?RiderID=5167).

For those outside the long-distance cycling world, the [Triple Crown](http://www.caltriplecrown.com/) means finishing three double centuries—200‑mile rides—in one year. It’s more about endurance, grit, and stubbornness than speed. That year, I rode the Hemet, Davis, and Grand Tour doubles. Each tested me differently: long climbs, headwinds, heat, fatigue, and doubt. Ride time averaged around 15.5 hours, including stops at support stations. Yes, your butt hurts for a few days afterward.

That same year, I also rode [Breathless Agony](http://www.cyclingpros.com/Onyx0504.htm)—105 miles, with 11,000 feet of climbing, ending at Onyx Summit at 8,400 feet. The name fits. The last climb is brutal, the kind where you count pedal strokes and wonder if you’ve got anything left. I asked myself more than once, “What the hell am I doing here?” and then kept going. I [came back and finished again in 2006](http://www.cyclingpros.com/Onyx0604.htm).

I didn’t do any of this to prove something to anyone but myself. I just wanted to see if I could. Looking back, it wasn’t about patches, jerseys, or times. It was about showing up. Riding through pain. Managing the mental battles after mile 150 or mile 100 when you’re climbing into thin air. And finishing, even when everything in you says to quit.

I’m not chasing finish lines anymore, but the lessons from those rides stick. Pace yourself. Stay steady. And when it gets hard, just keep pedaling.
