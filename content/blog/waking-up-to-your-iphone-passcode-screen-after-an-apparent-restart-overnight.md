Zac Hall at 9to5Mac [reports](https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/10/iphone-restart-overnight/) that some iPhone users are experiencing their phones turning off overnight, forcing them to enter their passcodes in the morning. This has been happening to me for a while. I can’t recall exactly when it started, but it occurred on my iPhone 11 on iOS 16 and continued with iOS 17. It has also happened on my iPad mini which would suggest it’s an OS issue.

I found this odd, but didn’t think much of it until I saw Zac’s post on 9to5Mac mentioning that others are experiencing the same issue.

The cause of the problem is unknown and Apple hasn’t yet commented on the issue.
