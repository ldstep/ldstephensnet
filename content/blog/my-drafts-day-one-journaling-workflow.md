Sparky and Stephen’s deep dive into journaling on the [Mac Power Users podcast episode 762](https://overcast.fm/+FrCG3vauU): got me thinking about how I approach this practice. So I thought I would chime in with how I journal.

Here’s my workflow:

-   **Quick capture with Drafts:** I use Drafts to write my text entries, it’s perfect for capturing fleeting thoughts or brain dumps.
-   **Monthly organization:** My [Drafts Monthly Journal](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Zk) keeps everything neatly organized, month by month.
-   **End-of-month migration:** At the month’s end, I seamlessly [share the entire journal with Day One](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/2Gs), preserving my reflections for posterity.
-   **Day One:** I use Day One to add images to my journal. I use it on my iPhone to take photos or import them from my camera roll.
-   **Daily dose of nostalgia:** Day One’s “On This Day” feature is my daily dose of happy memories and self-reflection.

This workflow is a part of my daily life. Drafts provides the perfect place for capturing fleeting thoughts, while Day One transforms them into memories I can revisit anytime.
