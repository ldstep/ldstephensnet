In September 2017, [I wrote a post on how to trigger PopClip when it didn’t appear using a Keyboard Maestro macro](https://ldstephens.net/2017/09/15/how-to-open-the-popclip-menu-on-a-selection/). With the release of [PopClip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) version 2021.11 on November 3rd you can now set a keyboard shortcut in PopClip preferences. This comes in handy when PopClip fails to appear or disappears.
