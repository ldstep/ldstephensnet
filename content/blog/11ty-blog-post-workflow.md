After [realizing](https://ldstephens.net/blog/my-ongoing-11ty-learning-curve/) that I don’t need a code editor to process a new blog post in 11ty I have a new workflow:

1.  Write the post in Markdown with front matter using [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/).
2.  Save as file to the Desktop, naming it with the post slug.
3.  Drag the file into the appropriate [Dropzone](https://aptonic.com/) folder that moves it into the correct location in the local 11ty project.
4.  Use GitHub Desktop to commit and push the changes.
