When I wrote about my [iPhone’s one page Home Screen](https://ldstephens.net/2024/05/10/my-iphone-home-screen-one-page-does-it-all/) I had forgotten how I had learned to create the “Choose From Menu” shortcut. Yesterday while cleaning out numerous old notes I came across the one I made on how to create the shortcut.

I learned how to create the shortcut from this article, [How to Create an App Launcher Using Shortcuts | appsntips](https://www.appsntips.com/learn/create-app-launcher-shortcut/). It explains how to create the shortcut from start to finish.
