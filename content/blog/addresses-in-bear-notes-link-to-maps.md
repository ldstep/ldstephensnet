I discovered this totally by accident. I was creating a note in the Bear notes app that included an address. What I found was, when I place an address in a note it becomes a link to the address in Apple Maps. Of course clicking the link takes me to the address in Maps. This saves having to launch Maps and type the address again. This can also be frustrating if you want a plain text address because there’s currently no way to disable address linking. I did find this workaround. If you bold the address it won’t link. It would nice if Bear would include an option for an address to be a link or plain text.
