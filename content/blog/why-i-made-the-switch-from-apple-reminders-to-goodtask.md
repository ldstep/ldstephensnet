I heavily relied on [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) to manage my daily tasks for quite some time. It’s an app that many of us are familiar with and trust. However, as my needs evolved, I found myself turning to Apple Reminders for a change. But it wasn’t long before I realized I needed more functionality, and that’s where [GoodTask](https://goodtaskapp.com) came into the picture. GoodTask is a powerful task management tool that builds upon Apple’s Reminders app and seamlessly integrates with your calendars as well.

Here are a few things that make GoodTask work for me:

GoodTask takes task organization to a whole new level. Its Custom Smart Lists feature allows me to sort tasks based on my specific criteria. Whether it’s prioritizing, categorizing, or customizing the view, GoodTask offers a high degree of flexibility. You can choose to view your tasks as traditional lists or opt for a Kanban-style board.

In addition, you can create subtasks, attach tags to your tasks, and set customizable deadlines complete with alerts. And Quick Actions and Shortcuts simplify the automation of routine tasks.

While Apple Reminders is a solid choice for basic task management, GoodTask’s exceptional customization options and advanced capabilities have allowed me to make my task manager function exactly as I want it to.
