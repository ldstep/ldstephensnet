This is a follow-up to [my article July 12, 2017](http://ldstephens.net/2017/07/12/1password-takes-it-on-the-chin-over-subscriptions-and-cloud-vaults/). Dave Teara, in an [agilebits blog post](https://blog.agilebits.com/2017/07/13/why-we-love-1password-memberships/), has clarified that for now local vaults will continue to be supported.

> Many Mac users worry that the same fate awaits 1Password 6 for Mac, and that we will remove support for local vaults and force them to pay again.

> This isn’t going to happen. First, it would be evil to take away something you’ve already paid for. And evil doesn’t make for a Happy 1Password Customer, which is the cornerstone for a Happy 1Password Maker. It’s simply not who we are.

> For those who purchased 1Password 6 for Mac already, you’re perfectly fine the way you are and can continue rocking 1Password the way you have been. There’s no requirement to change anything as we will not be removing features or forcing you to subscribe. In fact we’re still selling licenses of 1Password 6 for Mac for those that really need them (you can find them today on the setup screen under More Options).

> And you need not worry about 1Password 7 for Mac, either, as it will continue to support standalone vaults just like version 6 does today.

> We know that not everyone is ready to make the jump yet, and as such, we will continue to support customers who are managing their own standalone vaults. 1Password 6 and even 1Password 7 will continue to support standalone vaults.

There’s a message in Dave’s closing statement:

> But 1Password memberships are indeed awesome and are the best way to use 1Password, and as such, **_I am going to continue to nudge you over when ever I can_**.
