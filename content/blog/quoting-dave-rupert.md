> The cost of being online is getting too damn high and I’m tired of pretending it’s possible to fit these tasks into a normal life. That’s why I’d like to share a modest proposal for a new set of holidays to manage our digital lives:
> 
> (Ahem.)
> 
>  * A day to clear out your inboxes
>  * A day to reset your passwords and delete old accounts
>  * A day to fix your calendars
>  * A day to cancel online service subscriptions
>  * A day to manage the tags on your website
>  * A day to switch out any critical apps
>  * A day to backup your computer and phone
>  * A day to organize your photos
>  * A day to organize your music collection and playlists
>  * A day to setup your new phone/computer
>  * A day to try out a new app or major piece of software for your primary workflow
>  * A day to delete old text messages
