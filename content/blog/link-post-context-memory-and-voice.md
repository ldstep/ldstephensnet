> There are three mirrors I’ve discovered going too deep with the robots for the last few months. By deep, I mean I’ve built dozens of scripts, apps, and tools. Most were tossed away, but a few are now daily tools. I ask the robots questions all the time. I send the robots pictures. One particular mindblower was when I took a picture of a wall of LED lights at a hardware store, and the robot, based on prior questions, said, “Bottom shelf. Third one from the left.” It was right.

> The robots have repeatedly boggled my mind. And as I describe each mirror, I have good news and bad news. Then I have the worst news.
