[Reeder](https://www.reederapp.com) iCloud sync has been flaky since the 5.3.5 or 5.3.6 update 2 weeks ago. It’s fucking annoying me to no end. I have two options for resolving this frustration.

First I can subscribe to [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) which works fine with Reeder. Its sync is really fast. Of course, that’s going to cost me $50 bucks a year. Or second I can switch to [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) where iCloud sync works without issue. In fact, it’s nearly as fast as Feedbin’s sync.

My dilemma is this. I prefer Reeder over NetNewsWire. But am I willing to pay $50 a year for Feedbin to continue using it?

As I write this I’m realizing that I have a third option. Use NetNewsWire for now and hope that the developer of Reeder will fix the iCloud sync issue so that I can switch back to it.
