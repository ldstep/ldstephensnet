I don’t usually write about things like this but this is something I thought you might be able to benefit from as I did.

I live in Central New Jersey where the winter air is dry and cold. We have 20 acres of land with a small farm so I’m outside a lot with my hands exposed to the elements. Last winter I suffered from dry chapped cracked hands that were very sore. I tried several different brands of hand cream to alleviate the problem with little success. Yes, I even used the stuff in the green can.

Last July Ben Brooks wrote a review about Duke Cannon Care Products. [Bloody Knuckles](https://dukecannon.com/products/bloody-knuckles-hand-repair-balm) was the product that I was particularly interested in.

> Bloody Knuckles Hand Repair Balm: here’s how I tested this one, I moved across the country and handled tons of boxes. Those will eat your hands alive, unless that is you are using this hand balm. So yeah, two smooth feeling thumbs up. It takes a bit longer than I would like to soak in, but otherwise great stuff.

This fall and winter I’ve been using Bloody Knuckles and my hands are significantly better, and I haven’t had any dry cracking skin.

This stuff really works. Do yourself a favor and get some.

> Duke Cannon could have easily just been a gimmick brand with no real substance to it, I’ve seen that more than a few times. But at every turn the products were well above average and that’s saying a lot in the age of everyone outsourcing and branding cheap crap. This is not cheap crap. I wouldn’t be writing about it if it was.
