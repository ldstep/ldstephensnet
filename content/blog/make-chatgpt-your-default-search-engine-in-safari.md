I’ve started using AI for search lately, and the results are not only better but faster than google or DDG search. One thing I discovered recently is that the ChatGPT app includes a Safari extension for iOS and iPadOS.

Once you’ve installed the official ChatGPT app, go to:
**Settings > Safari > Extensions > ChatGPT Search > Allow Extension**

This adds ChatGPT to the Safari toolbar, allowing you to search directly from the browser. It becomes your default search engine. If I want to use something else, I switch to [xSearch](https://ldstephens.net/blog/xsearch-a-safari-extension-for-improved-searching-on-iphone-and-ipad/), which I previously wrote about.

I’m putting this out there for those who might be interested in using ChatGPT as their default search engine.
