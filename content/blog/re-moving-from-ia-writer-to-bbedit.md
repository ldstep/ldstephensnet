> nor do I agree with the direction in which the development of iA Writer is headed […] new features like ‘Authorship’ which I have little use for,

This morning, I read Juha-Matti Santala's [post](https://hamatti.org/posts/whats-the-story-my-front-page-tells/) responding to [V.H. Belvadi's post about the homepage quandary](https://vhbelvadi.com/the-homepage-quandary). Since I wasn’t familiar with Belvadi, I checked out his site and found his [post](https://vhbelvadi.com/bbedit) about switching from iA Writer to BBEdit.

What caught my attention was his take on iA’s Authorship feature. Like V.H., I have no use for it and actually find it annoying to deal with. This week’s iA Writer update made things worse — “generated text now bursts onto the page in a rainbow.” It was already frustrating before, but this change sealed it for me. iA is no longer my text editor of choice.

I write in Drafts. When a post is complete, I use an action to save it as a Markdown file to the desktop, then open it in BBEdit to add the front matter and make final edits. If you’re interested in learning more about BBEdit, besides V.H.’s post, you might also want to read [Nicolas Magand’s post](https://thejollyteapot.com/2025/09/05/why-i-love-bbedit/) titled “Why I Love BBEdit.” You may also be interested in my [bbedit-md-text-filters](https://github.com/ldstep/bbedit-md-text-filters), a collection of custom text filters for processing Markdown in BBEdit.
