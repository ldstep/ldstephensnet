I read this post by [Brandon on Mastodon](https://easymode.im/notes/9l4cjkesbzidcapi) and he explains how he almost got scammed selling some stuff online. A potential buyer sent him their number and requested a text message exchange. Trustingly, Brandon obliged, but the situation quickly took a suspicious turn. The buyer asked for a six-digit code, supposedly for safety verification. It turned out to be a Google Voice verification code, part of a scam to take control of his phone number. Fortunately, Brandon recognized the scheme due to his background in social engineering, and he reported the fraudster while blocking them.

Warning, use caution when sharing verification codes and changing platforms with strangers during online transactions.
