[Mac Power User episode 587 Getting to Know Notion, with August Bradley](https://www.relay.fm/mpu/578) was about how August uses [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). It has been getting a fair amount of buzz lately so I decided to check it out.

[First what is Notion](https://www.notion.so/product)? It is an all-in-one workspace that provides components such as notes, databases, wikis, calendars, and reminders.

I spent an entire day getting to know the app. To get started I watched several [videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=notion) so that I would have some idea of what I was doing when opened the app to nothing more than a blank page. Next, I worked with a few of the built-in templates, made my own notes notebook, and started making a notes database. By the end of the day, I had a basic understanding of how things work in Notion.

Here is my takeaway. For personal use Notion is a powerful personal wiki app that requires building out components for what it is that you want from the app. It also takes a lot of customization and tweaking. I could see that this could become a major time suck. Why not just use an app instead?

Things to consider:

-   The learning curve
-   You have to build the components that you want
-   No clipper for Safari (this was very disappointing)
-   The app performance is slow
-   [Why You Need To STOP Using Notion For Your Whole Life!](https://beingpaperless.com/notion-concerns-and-first-impressions/)

After a day of using the app, I donâ€™t see a use case for me. Of course, this is my opinion. Your situation may be different.

Since Notion is free for personal use I might continue experimenting with it just for the learning experience. But, I doubt that it could ever become part of my workflow.
