I've been using [Ice]([https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/discussions/672](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/discussions/672)) to manage the menu bar on my M4 MacBook Pro running macOS Tahoe. Occasionally, it crashes, and I have to force quit the app and restart it. However, there's one problem with this process: Ice doesn't appear in the Apple > Force Quit options. Instead, I have to open Activity Monitor, locate Ice, and force quit it from there before restarting the app. If you're experiencing this issue with Ice crashing, I hope this helps. It's kinda irritating and I wish the developer would release an update to fix it.
