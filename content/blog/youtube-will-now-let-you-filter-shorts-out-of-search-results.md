My use of YouTube is primarily educational. I typically start with a search for answers to specific how-to questions. The results often include a mix of long-form videos and Shorts. I have zero interest in Shorts, so having to sift through them can be pretty fucking irritating.

As part of [recent changes to its search filters](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/400586735?hl=en), YouTube is introducing the ability to search specifically for Shorts or long-form videos. In the new filters menu, you can choose "Videos," which only displays long-form results, or "Shorts," which shows exactly what you'd expect.

I hope you found this helpful.
