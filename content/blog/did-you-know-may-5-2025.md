Did you know you can require Face ID or Touch ID before an app launches on iPhone or iPad? I didnâ€™t, until recently. There are so many features hiding in plain sight that we miss.

To set it up, just long-press an app icon on your Home Screen or in the App Library, then tap Require Face ID or Touch ID, depending on your device. It's an extra layer of protection for apps like your journal, bank, or password manager and more.

Once enabled, the app locks immediately. The next time anyone tries to open it, they'll need Face ID or a passcode. To disable it, just tap Turn Off Require Face ID and the app goes back to opening normally.
