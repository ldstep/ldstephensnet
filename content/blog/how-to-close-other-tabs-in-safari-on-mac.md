Sometimes I have several tabs open in Safari when I’m searching for something to write about. When I’ve settled on something I often want to close all the other open tabs. Rather than closing each tab individually, I do the following:

1.  Right-click (or Control+Click) on the tab I want to keep open
2.  Choose “Close Other Tabs” to instantly close all the other open tabs
