I was looking at [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) reviews in the App Store today and noticed several recent reviews with complaints about iCloud sync issues. This is not a new issue. It has been an ongoing issue for several years. It’s the main reason that [I no longer use Ulysses](http://ldstephens.net/2020/02/06/goodbye-ulysses/).

I would think that Ulysses would do something to fix this problem. Of course, they always say the problem is with iCloud Drive and not Ulysses. I don’t buy that because lots of other apps use iCloud with no problems. I recently wrote about that [here](http://ldstephens.net/2020/01/25/bear-notes-app-icloud-sync/).

Maybe they should spend some of their subscription money on developing a sync backend.
