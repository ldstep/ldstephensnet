> I was reading a post the other day about how someone would struggle to move away from Apple as they're all in with them. I can understand this, as it _nearly_ happened to me too.

> For the life of me I can't find the post, but it was on someone's personal blog. If I find it, I'll update this post, but in the meantime, the gist of the post was that they were struggling with Apple's ever diminishing reputation, but they were so entrenched into their ecosystem that they thought it would be nigh on impossible to move away.[…] So, to the person who's blog post I can no longer find, don't feel like you're stuck in the Apple ecosystem, or any other ecosystem for that matter.

I’ve read a few posts like this lately from longtime Apple users thinking about leaving the ecosystem over recent decisions by Apple leadership. I get the frustration, but jumping ship? I don’t see it.

Where are you going to go? Google? Microsoft? Samsung? These companies aren’t any better. In some ways, they’re worse. From Tim Cook down, Apple’s execs have shown [they’re not worthy of our trust](https://ldstephens.net/blog/on-can-we-still-love-apple-should-we-ever-have/). As stewards of the company, they’ve revealed who they are. I love my Apple products. But the company? Not so much anymore.

I’ve been on both sides of the fence. Still, for all its flaws, Apple’s products are superior. The integration, the hardware, and the privacy are unmatched. Sometimes the devil you know really is better than the one you don’t.
