I’m guessing you’re aware of [what’s going on between Epic and Apple](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/). It’s been the big story in tech news for a few weeks. Yesterday [Apple terminated Epic’s App Store account](https://9to5mac.com/2020/08/28/apple-has-now-terminated-epic-games-app-store-account/), as threatened, following a legal dispute between the companies. This is headed for the courts and is going to be playing out over the next several months.

I’m enjoying watching this battle. Its two big tech companies fighting it out over a lot of money. I do tend to side with Apple on this because of the brazen and calculating way Epic has brought this on them self.

The Apple pundits have differing opinions on who’s right or wrong but I like Jason Snell and David Sparks take on this kerfuffle.

Jason Snell:  
[Epic versus Apple? I’m rooting for the users](https://www.macworld.com/article/3572441/epic-versus-apple-im-rooting-for-the-users.html)

> The thing is, I don’t really back all the actions of either party in this kerfuffle. Instead, I’m squarely on the side of the people who use technology. Let’s leave aside the tech giants. What are the outcomes that would most benefit regular users?
> 
> So who am I rooting for in this case? I’m hoping that the judges, along with the legislators and regulators, don’t get distracted by the sight of two large, profitable companies squabbling in court and lose sight of the most important party in this case—the people who use these products every day.

David Sparks:  
[Apple’s Troubles and MacSparky Coverage — MacSparky](https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2020/8/apples-troubles-and-macsparky-coverage)

> Lately, Apple has been dealing with several percolating problems. Governments, at home and abroad, are interested in their business practices. Troubles between the United States and China are now threatening Apple’s business in one of its biggest markets. Big and small developers are now finding ways to exert pressure against the existing App Store model.
> 
> I have had several readers/listeners write in asking me to cover these topics more, but to be honest, I’m just not that interested.

> I am much more concerned about all of the families that have lost loved ones and all of the people out of work due to this pandemic than the troubles of a $2 trillion company.
