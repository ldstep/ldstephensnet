Since installing the iPadOS 26 beta, I've been doing most of my computering on my M2 iPad Air and I'm planning to stick with it for the entire beta period. 

I've always been able to do the majority of my work on the iPad just as easily as on my Mac, sometimes even more easily. But the one thing I've never been fully comfortable with on the iPad is my blogging workflow. 

The changes in iPadOS 26 have allowed me to put together a blogging workflow that's working out pretty well for me. Actually, it's not all that dissimilar to Mac workflow.  

**iPad blogging workflow**

*Drafts*

1. Capture ideas
2. Write blog posts
3. Save post as a file to Drafts folder
4. Slugify the file title

*Runestone*

1. Open post from Drafts folder
2. Add YAML front matter
3. Move post to the appropriate project folder

*Working Copy*

1. Commit changes to GitHub
2. Push to local Git repository

*Deploy*

1. Changes to GitHub trigger a build on Netlify

I’ve always enjoyed working on the iPad because it’s simply enjoyable. The tactile experience of tapping, swiping, and dragging things around is unlike anything you can do on a regular computer. With the Magic Keyboard, I get the best of both worlds: smooth typing and a trackpad, all while maintaining the touch-first experience.

All that being said, once the iPadOS 26 public release is available, I’ll make a decision about how the iPad will integrate into my computering.
