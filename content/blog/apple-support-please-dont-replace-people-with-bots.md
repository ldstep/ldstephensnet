"Apple appears to be developing an [AI-based "Support Assistant"](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/08/apple-support-assistant/) for the Apple Support app. Signs of the feature were found in Apple code by MacRumors contributor Aaron Perris, but the Support Assistant doesn't appear to be live in the app as of yet.[â€¦] _Apple's code says that users will have the option to consult with an Apple advisor for help after using the Support Assistant feature_."

I rarely use Apple Support, but when I do, one thing I appreciate is getting a real person, not a bot. This sounds like a step backward for the Apple Support experience if this is true.
