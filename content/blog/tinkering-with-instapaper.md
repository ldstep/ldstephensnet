I've been using [Goodlinks](https://goodlinks.app) as my read-it-later app for the past few years. I switched to it when [Instapaper](https://ldstephens.net/blog/open-letter-to-the-developers-of-instapaper/) was going through a stretch of neglect. Instapaper used to be my favorite read-it-later app, so I've kept tabs on it ever since.

Lately, Instapaper has been under active development, so I got curious and started tinkering with it the other day. There's a lot to like. I especially like how it integrates with Reeder. A swipe gesture saves an article and I can read my Instapaper saves right in the Reeder app. I also like being able to highlight text and share those highlights as plain text, Markdown, or HTML for notes, quotes, or even blog posts.

I've stopped bookmarking stuff so I'm able to get along with using the free version of the app. As I said, I'm tinkering, so we'll see if Instapaper can replace Goodlinks.
