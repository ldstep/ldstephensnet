Having a trackpad on my iPhone and iPad comes in really handy for moving the cursor around in a document versus trying to tap the cursor where I want it.

If you’re not using the trackpad feature you should give it a try. Here’s how:

> If your device has 3D Touch – which includes most iPhones since 2015’s iPhone 6s – you can **hard press the keyboard** whenever it’s present onscreen, turning it into a makeshift trackpad. If you have an iPhone SE or iPhone XR with iOS 12 -both of which lack 3D Touch -you can now **long-press the spacebar** to invoke the same trackpad.
