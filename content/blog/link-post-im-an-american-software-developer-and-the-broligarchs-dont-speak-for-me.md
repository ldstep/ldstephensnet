> Here I am, a software developer in the year 2025. I look around at "tech" in the news and in culture and I donâ€™t like what I see. Something has gone really, really wrong with the Big Tech "bros" and I cannot keep silent about it any longer. Because the broligarchs do not represent me _at all_.[â€¦] If all I can accomplish here is to be understood, thatâ€™s enough. I can, after all, only speak for myself. But I have a feeling Iâ€™m not alone. I have a feeling that there are a lot of other people in the tech world who do not want to be thought of as the cold-blooded instruments of mad kings bent on destroying everything in order to remake the world as a dystopian techno-state.

This is an excellent read, even if youâ€™re not a developer.
