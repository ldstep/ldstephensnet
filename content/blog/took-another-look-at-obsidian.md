The other day I read a post by [Denny Henke](https://beardystarstuff.net/2023/11/26/its-only-been.html) where he writes about [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

> It’s only been a couple weeks since I decided to give Obsidian yet another try and yes, this is going to work out. I’m so glad I decided to give it a try again. First, my primary use of any markdown/text app is for writing blog posts. In this regard Obsidian is generally on par with any other markdown editor and so it’s easy to just copy my archive over. That’s the beauty of working from folders of files.

After reading Denny’s post, I decided to give Obsidian another try. The last time I tried Obsidian, there were no iOS or iPadOS apps and very few plugins, so it has evolved considerably since then.

I spent most of the past two days exploring Obsidian. Like Denny, my primary use for a markdown/text editor is writing blog posts and journal entries, not knowledge management. Ultimately, I found that Obsidian is not the right fit for me. For simply writing blog posts and journal entries, I prefer the simpler and more streamlined experience of a dedicated writing app like [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer).
