In a recent post, [Andreas at 82MHz](https://82mhz.net/posts/2025/05/old-software-still-has-value/) wrote about how old software can still be useful and fun. It’s a good read, so I wanted to share it here.

He set up a 2006 MacBook with its original OS and iLife suite and had a great time using GarageBand with a MIDI keyboard. Even after 20 years, the hardware and software still work and are a joy to use. Just because something’s outdated doesn’t mean it’s useless.

For example, authors [George R.R. Martin](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27407502) and [Robert J. Sawyer](https://sfwriter.com/ws7.htm) still write using WordStar for DOS, a program last updated in 1992. Sawyer even shares his setup online, complete with documentation.

It’s a good reminder that sometimes the tools we need and love are the ones we’ve had all along.
