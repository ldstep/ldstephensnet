This last week I kept seeing news articles about [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) in my RSS feed. Yesterday I decided it must be something big to get that much press so I checked it out.

So I ask ChatGPT: write a 200 word explanation for how ChatGPT works and here’s the result:

> ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) model that uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like responses to text inputs. It is based on the GPT-3 model, which is a state-of-the-art language model that uses a transformer architecture to process and generate text.
> 
> When given a text input, ChatGPT uses its internal knowledge of language and its ability to generate context-aware responses to generate a response that is relevant to the input. It uses this knowledge to understand the context of the conversation and generate a response that is appropriate and coherent.
> 
> The model is trained on large amounts of data, including books, articles, and other written text. This allows it to learn the nuances of language and generate responses that sound natural to a human reader.
> 
> In addition to generating responses, ChatGPT also has the ability to generate entire conversations. It can maintain the context of a conversation and continue to generate relevant responses as the conversation progresses.
> 
> Overall, ChatGPT is a powerful tool for generating human-like text responses and facilitating natural language conversations. It has the potential to be used in a variety of applications, from chatbots to language translation systems.

Then I ask it a couple of more questions.

Write 100 word description of Drafts app for Mac:

> Drafts is a versatile writing and note-taking app for Mac. It allows users to quickly capture and organize their thoughts and ideas in one place. With a simple and intuitive interface, Drafts makes it easy to jot down notes, create to-do lists, and even draft longer documents. It also integrates with other apps and services, allowing users to quickly share their notes and ideas with others. Additionally, Drafts offers a range of customizable options, including templates and themes, so users can tailor the app to their specific needs. Overall, Drafts is a powerful tool for anyone looking to streamline their writing and note-taking process on their Mac.

Write a 100 word description of Popclip for Mac:

> PopClip is a Mac app that extends the functionality of the macOS clipboard. It automatically appears when users select text with their cursor, providing quick access to a range of actions including copy and paste, as well as third-party app integrations for tasks such as looking up a word on a dictionary or translating text. PopClip also allows users to customize the appearance and functionality of the pop-up menu to fit their needs. Overall, PopClip aims to make common tasks on the Mac faster and more convenient.

That’s pretty fucking amazing!

You can get a free account with [OpenAI](https://auth0.openai.com/u/login/identifier?state=hKFo2SBERTc5NU5ob1BPWHdnbEhFZ1pBNVk4UG1lXzM5dWRGcKFur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIG9haGNZa2JRVnBQTGt2RG96dHphOXBOVnc1TTZKYmloo2NpZNkgRFJpdnNubTJNdTQyVDNLT3BxZHR3QjNOWXZpSFl6d0Q) and then give the program a task by describing what you want it to do in plain English.
