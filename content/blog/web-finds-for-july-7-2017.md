Web Finds are from my web surfing travels. You’ll find some unique, informative, and some of the coolest websites and apps that you may have never known existed. Enjoy!

**[CheatSheet  
](https://www.grandtotal.biz/CheatSheet/?lang=en)**CheatSheet is a free Mac app that displays an app’s keyboard shortcuts in an opaque pop-up in the vein of a Quick Look preview. Holding down the command key for a couple seconds brings up the entire list of shortcuts for the active application. While holding down the command key, you can click on commands with your mouse cursor to activate that command. If you want to learn all of the useful keyboard shortcuts to get the most out of your Applications, CheatSheet is what you’ve been looking for. It runs in the background without taking up menubar or dock space on your Mac.

**[AppCleaner](http://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/)  
**AppCleaner is a small Mac application which allows you to thoroughly uninstall unwanted apps. Installing an application distributes many files throughout your System using space of your Hard Drive unnecessarily. AppCleaner finds all these small files and safely deletes them.

**[Screens 4  
](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/screens-4-vnc-remote-desktop-screen-sharing/id1224268771?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude)**Screens is a powerful VNC client app that lets you control any computer from anywhere as if you were sitting in front of it! Screens 4.0 for macOS adds curtain mode, drag-and-drop file transfers, touch bar support, and more.
