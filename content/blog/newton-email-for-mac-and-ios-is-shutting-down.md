Recently, more and more developers have switched to subscription pricing. Folks hate this model (including me) and seek out alternatives. [Newton](https://newtonhq.com) email is a casualty of the pricing model. Long term I think this model will fail for a lot of developers.

> Newton, a popular email service for iOS and Mac, is shutting down on September 25, the company’s founder Rohit Nadhani announced today.
> 
> Newton is a subscription-based app that costs $9.99 per month or $99.99 per year, a business model that did not end up being successful. Nadhani says that the company explored “various business models” but wasn’t able to “successfully figure out profitability & growth over the long term.”
