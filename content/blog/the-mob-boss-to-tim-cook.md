“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump said. “I said to him, ‘my friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India.’ I don’t want you building in India.”[…] “I said to Tim, I said, ‘Tim look, we treated you really good, we put up with all the plants that you build in China for years, now you got build us. We’re not interested in you building in India, India can take care of themselves ... we want you to build here’,” Trump said.

According to [Vox](https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/9/13/17851052/apple-iphone-price-china-trump-us-trade), If Apple were to manufacture and assemble iPhones entirely in the U.S. under policies like those promoted by Trump, the cost per device could skyrocket. Analysts estimate that a fully U.S. made iPhone could retail for around $3,500--more than triple the current price of approximately $1,000.

So the plan is to bring iPhone production to the U.S. and slap a $3,500 price tag on it. And who ends up getting screwed? The U.S. consumer yet again.
