I live in New Jersey, and knowing the current weather conditions here in the Northeast is pretty important. We experience just about everything: hot, sticky summers with heatwaves and sudden thunderstorms; winters with rain, snow, ice, and the occasional nor'easter. Spring and fall can swing from mild to messy, with heavy rain and strong winds. Throw in the rare tornado or hurricane, and you get the idea.

Which brings me to [Carrot Weather](https://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/). I've been using it for several years, but I won't be renewing my subscription when it comes up in a few months. Don't get me wrong, Carrot is a great app. My issue is with the accuracy of the weather sources it uses. According to [ForecastAdvisor](https://www.forecastadvisor.com/NewJersey/Farmingdale/07727/), The Weather Company is the most accurate for my area and that's not an option in Carrot.

I've been beta testing [Hello Weather 4](https://helloweather.com/) for a few months, and it does offer The Weather Company as a source. Since switching, I've been getting noticeably more accurate hourly and 10-day forecasts. Honestly, if Carrot added The Weather Company, I'd stick with it. I really do like the app. By the way, I use the NBC 4 New York weather app for the most accurate radar.

But for now, accuracy wins. So I'm switching to Hello Weather.
