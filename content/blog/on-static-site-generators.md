Hey friends, I read this in a blog post the other day: _“For example, if you are struggling to blog now with a text box on a website that handles it all for you, what makes you think selfhosting and having to use the CLI to get some SSG to build it will get you to blog more? It’s way more effort to post like that! You can’t even do it without your computer.”_

I think this warrants some clarification. Static site generators (SSGs) are not about increasing your blogging frequency; they are about having total control and ownership of your site, as opposed to relying on a platform that limits your independence.

Yes, if your site is built with a static site generator, you will need a computer to publish changes. However, using a hosted platform like Bear, where you write in a box, means you are tied to the decisions made by the platform owner. You can't simply pack up and move your site somewhere else without navigating a bunch of obstacles, if it's even possible.

With an SSG, your content resides in plain text files (Markdown, HTML, CSS) that you control. The build process transforms those files into a complete website that you can host anywhere. If you decide to switch hosts or tools, you can easily take your files with you. In contrast, with a platform, your content often exists in a database or proprietary format, making it much harder or even impossible to export cleanly and rehost.

**TL;DR:** Platforms are convenient but lock you in. SSGs require more setup but offer total control and ownership.
