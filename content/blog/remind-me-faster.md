Last week, I was [messing around](https://ldstephens.net/blog/reminders-menubar/) with Apple’s Reminders app. I’m still using Things, but I found a handy iOS app called [Remind Me Faster](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remind-me-faster/id985555908) that makes adding tasks to Reminders super quick. Why does that matter if I’m using Things? Because Things 3 can import tasks from the Reminders Inbox list.

When you use the iOS share sheet to send something to Things, you can’t set a due date or time. But with Remind Me Faster, you can. It lets you create a reminder with a due date and time in the Reminders Inbox, ready for Things to import. Whether you’re using Reminders or Things I think you’ll like this little app.
