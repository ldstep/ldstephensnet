Over the last few months, I have become increasingly frustrated with [Instapaper](https://instapaper.com) as my read later app.

Here’s why. I read a lot of how-to articles and right now is a prime time for that sort of thing with all the articles about iOS 13 and iPadOS and soon macOS Catalina. These articles typically use images for illustration. For me, the illustrations add a lot to my understanding of what I’m reading.

So, here’s my rub with Instapaper. The majority of the time images are missing in articles. Because they are missing I then have to open the article in Safari and then switch to reader view. This is a waste of time. Unfortunately, Instapaper has never done a good job handling images and videos.

Having used [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) in the past I know that it does do a good job handling images and videos. And, If by chance images are missing in an article I can switch to web view right within the app. No need to go to Safari. I also prefer Pocket’s tags to Instapaper’s folders for organization.

As a side note Pocket is now part of [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org) and since taking it over they have removed sponsored ads from lists in the free version of Pocket. They also just released [Pocket for Safari](https://getpocket.com/safari/) extension for Safari 13.

Overall I’m finding Pocket to be a much better experience.
