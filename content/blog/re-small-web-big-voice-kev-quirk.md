> Despite what sites like _ProBlogger_ say, I don’t have a niche, and I don’t try to grow my audience ([I don’t even know how big my audience is](https://kevquirk.com/blog/revisiting-the-web-analytics-rabbit-hole/)). I just write whatever is on my mind at any given time, and people usually get in touch with me to discuss the topic. It’s fantastic.

I enjoyed Kev's post and would like to comment on audience size. Many small web bloggers judge their site's success or failure based on analytics, but that perspective is often incomplete. Analytics merely measure your drive-by traffic. Whether you track everything or nothing, you cannot truly gauge the size of your audience. You’ll never know how many people follow your site in an RSS reader, which is often where your real audience resides.
