I’ve had it with Twitter and closed my account this week. That said, I want to still want follow a handful of accounts.

Here’s how I’m doing it. [Nitter](https://nitter.net/about) is a free and open-source alternative to Twitter focused on privacy and performance. The source is available on GitHub at[https://github.com/zedeus/nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter).

Nitter provides RSS feeds for every Twitter user: [https://nitter.net/username/rss](https://nitter.net/username/rss). Now I’m following that handful of Twitter accounts in my RSS feed reader thanks to Nitter
