> Call it [the indie web](https://indieweb.org/), [the small web](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/) or [the slow web](https://www.jackcheng.com/the-slow-web/). Do or don't label it — buy a domain, stand up a site, write and share. Find other folks doing it — maybe on Mastodon, maybe on another network, protocol or application — find out who they're following and look at their sites. See what they've linked to and are reading.[…] What we have is an opportunity to contribute to a healthier web, one that's slower, weirder, less commercial and more holistic. We can aim to empower folks to share on their own stories on their own terms. It can be silly, irreverent or deeply serious — it's up to the author. They can elect to share everything — or nothing at all.
