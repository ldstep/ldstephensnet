My love hate relationship with [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) is finally over. It’s been over a month since I canceled my Ulysses subscription and deleted it from my Mac, iPhone, and iPad. I haven’t missed it one bit. The combination of [Bear](https://bear.app/) and [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) for my writing projects has worked out well. If you want to read all I’ve written about Ulysses, good and bad, you can find it [here](https://ldstephens.net/?s=Ulysses).
