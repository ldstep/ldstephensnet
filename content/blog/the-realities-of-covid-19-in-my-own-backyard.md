The COVID-19 death numbers for New York City are beyond comprehension. When you hear them it feels more like a nightmare than reality. But unfortunately, they are real. As of this morning (April 03, 2020), there are 57,159 cases including 1,562 deaths. In my state of New Jersey there are 25,590 cases with 539 deaths. The sad part of all this is it’s going to get worse before it gets better.

Let’s all do our part: Stay the hell home!
