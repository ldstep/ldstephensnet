[As you will recall](http://ldstephens.net/2020/05/21/weight-management/) I had gained a couple of pounds over the winter and wanted to lose them. Once I had done that I wanted to maintain a specific weight. For me, the easiest way to do this has always been tracking calories. Calories in and calories out.

What I’ve found after doing this for a couple of months is that counting calories makes me make better food choices so that I stay within my Recommended Daily Intake (RDI). Based on my age, weight, height, and activity level my RDI is approximately 2000 calories per day to maintain my current weight. Prior to counting, I was eating between 1000 and 1500 calories more than my recommended daily requirement.

With all that said, I’m trying a new food tracking app [FoodNoms](https://foodnoms.com) that [Casey Liss](https://www.caseyliss.com/) mentioned in [Episode 385 of Accidental Tech Podcast](https://atp.fm/385). It’s taking a few days to get used to it because it works differently than the app that I’m used to using. But, the more I use it the more I’m liking it and I think I’ll be sticking with it. By the way, the app walks you through the calculation to determine your RDI.

If you’re interested in getting a handle on your weight you should give the app a try. There’s a free version of the app which is what I using. There’s also FoodNoms Plus which is a subscription. I think most people could probably get along with just the free version.

John Voorhees did a nice review of the app over on MacStories. Go check it out [FoodNoms: A Privacy-Focused Food Tracker with Innovative New Ways to Log Meals – MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/foodnoms-a-privacy-focused-food-tracker-with-innovative-new-ways-to-log-meals/).
