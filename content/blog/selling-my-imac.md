I’m selling my late 2013 21.5” non-retina iMac. It’s getting old and tired, lots of beach balls these days. I’m also having some issues with Bluetooth. At times the keyboard and mouse get all wonky since upgrading too Mojave.

My early 2015 13” MacBook Pro is in great shape and way faster than the old iMac. The only thing I think I’ll miss is the extra screen space of the iMac. But, I figure I can use my iPad as a second screen in the event I need more screen space.

I usually sell my stuff to [Gazelle](https://www.gazelle.com/trade-in) but as of the first of July, they are no longer buying Macs. That was actually quite a surprise since I had just gotten a quote for my iMac from them in June. So instead, I’m selling it to [Sell Your Mac](https://www.sellyourmac.com). They are actually paying a little more than what Gazelle offered me back in June.

I’m looking forward to not having to keep 2 Macs up to date and in sync any longer.
