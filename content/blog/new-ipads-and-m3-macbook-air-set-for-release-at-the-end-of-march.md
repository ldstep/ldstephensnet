> Apple’s next MacBook Airs and iPads get closer to release. Back in December, I reported that Apple had pretty extensive plans for March: There will be several new iPads, alongside the next batch of Macs with M3 chips. More specifically, you should expect the biggest revamp ever for the iPad Pro, a refreshed iPad Air, a larger iPad Air, and 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs with M3 processors. The latest: I’m told these machines are likely to come out around the end of March — and that the new iPad Pros and 13-inch MacBook Air are already deep in production overseas.

Looks like I may be indulging in some Apple upgrades in March. At the top of my list is an M3 MacBook Air to replace my trusty M1. And if Apple unveils a new M3 iPad Mini, well, that’s a no-brainer too. I recently wrote about how seamlessly [my iPad Mini and MacBook Air work together](https://ldstephens.net/2024/01/23/12-months-with-the-ipad-mini/), and the extra screen real estate of a 15″ Air is tempting. I rarely travel in which case, my 11″ M2 iPad Pro will go with me instead of the more bulky 15″ MacBook Air.
