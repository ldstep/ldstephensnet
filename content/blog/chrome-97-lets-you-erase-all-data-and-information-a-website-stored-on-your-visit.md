I don’t use Chrome but I know a lot of Mac users do use Chrome or a Chromium-based browser. Chrome 97 released yesterday comes with a significant Security & Privacy improvement that I want to bring to your attention.

> Chrome 97 makes some changes to the Privacy and Security settings. You can now delete all the data stored by a website. Previously, you could only delete individual cookies. This new setting can be found at Settings > Security and Privacy > Site Settings > View Permissions and Data Stored Across Sites.​
