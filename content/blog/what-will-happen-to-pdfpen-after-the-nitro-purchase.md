[PDFpen](https://pdfpen.com/pdfpen-ios/) has been a part of [my paperless workflow](https://ldstephens.net/2017/05/21/ive-gone-paperless/) since I started it in 2017. Yesterday after [reading about Nitro acquiring PDFpen on 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/28/pdfpen-sold/) I decided that it’s time to move on to a different app.

**[June 28, 2021 – Nitro to acquire PDFpen, expanding productivity to Mac, iPhone, and iPad users](https://www.gonitro.com/about/press/nitro-to-acquire-pdfpen)**

> Nitro Software Limited (ASX: NTO) (‘Nitro’ or the ‘Company’), a global document productivity software company driving digital transformation in organisations around the world, is pleased to announce the acquisition of PDFpen, a market-leading suite of PDF productivity applications for Mac, iPhone® and iPad®.

> Under the terms of the acquisition, Nitro will acquire the PDFpen technology from US- based Smile, Inc. for $6 million in cash. The acquisition will be funded from the Company’s existing cash reserves.

According to the announcement, [Nitro](https://www.gonitro.com) purchased the PDFpen technology (see the paragraph above). That brings up the question of what does that mean for the app? Does this mean Nitro will use the PDFpen technology to develop Nitro apps for Mac, iPhone, and iPad and PDFpen will eventually disappear from the app landscape?

In light of this announcement and not being happy with PDFpen’s incredible confusing interface on the iPhone and iPad, I’m now using [PDFViewer](https://pdfviewer.io), which has a free version which is perfect for limited needs.
