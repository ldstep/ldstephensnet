I waited for a few days to install the iOS 11 update on my iPhone 7 Plus. I wanted to make sure I wasn’t hearing or reading about issues before I jumped in. The installation went smoothly and it only took about 20 minutes. I had heard some comments about it taking up to an hour or more so I was surprised it went so quickly. After the update completed I tested all my apps and they are all working fine.

The overall look and feel of iOS 11 is somewhat different from iOS 10. The new iOS 11 design theme now features large bold titles that feel in your face. Don’t like it. I read part of Federico’s review and there doesn’t seem to be a way to get rid of them. Oh well. It’ll take some getting used to.

Two new features that I’ll be using are Do Not Disturb While Driving and Emergency SOS to disable Touch ID if I find myself in an emergency situation. The new Control Center was a little confusing at first but with the help of Federico’s review, I quickly got a grasp of how it works.

I’m not an iPad user so I can’t comment about iOS 11 on iPad.

If you’re looking for a full review of iOS 11 I recommend [Federico Viticci’s review](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-11-the-macstories-review/) at MacStories or by [Andrew Cunningham’s review](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/09/ios-11-thoroughly-reviewed/) at Ars Technica.
