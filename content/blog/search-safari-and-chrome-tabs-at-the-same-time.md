As you all know I’m a big fan of [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). I use it more than any other app on my Mac.

Here’s a helpful workflow I found a few weeks ago and I’d like to share it with you.

Do you ever have tabs open in Safari and Chrome and want to go to a specific tab but you can’t remember whether it’s open in Safari or Chrome? Here’s an Alfred workflow that lets you search the open tabs in both browsers at the same time.

The workflow is “Search Safari and Chrome Tabs” and you can download it [here](http://www.packal.org/workflow/search-safari-and-chrome-tabs).

To search your tabs, type “tabs” in the Alfred bar followed by your search term.

When you select a result, it’ll bring your browser to the front and switch to the selected tab. You can also close a tab by holding down alt when selecting a result.
