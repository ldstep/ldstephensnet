Sometimes websites that I regularly visit have a font that’s so small my aging eyes have difficulty reading it. Safari 11 for Mac has a nice feature that lets me set a permanent zoom level for those websites. Now, the next time I visit the site it’s already zoomed to the level I need for easy reading. Safari does this automatically, but the zoom can also be controlled from Safari Preferences **Safari > Preferences > Websites > Page Zoom.** You’ll see all the websites that are open, and those that are already configured (if you’ve already changed the zoom).
