Forget the Pro, the iPad Mini has finally won me over. After years of failed attempts to make iPads my go-to device, this little powerhouse has redefined how I use the iPad.

It’s become my most used device, effortlessly handling tasks I used to rely on my iPhone and even my MacBook for. From watching videos to jotting down notes with Apple Pencil to researching blog posts on the couch, and my RSS reader the Mini’s perfect size makes it my constant companion.

Yes, I still grab my M1 MacBook Air when it’s time to write and do more complex tasks. It’s still my work-horse but the iPad has found a place in my life with the Mini.
