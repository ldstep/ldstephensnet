After rebranding Twitter as “X”, Elon Musk took the `@x` handle from its original owner, Gene X. Hwang, and offered him merchandise as compensation.

Mr. Hwang received an email from the company explaining that his account data would be preserved, and he would be given a new handle. The email also offered Mr. Hwang merchandise, a tour of its offices, and a meeting with company management.

**Merchandise? Let’s think about that for a minute.**

The average price that Twitter handles sell for varies depending on several factors, including the length and uniqueness of the handle, the number of followers the account has, and the industry the account is in. However, Twitter handles can generally sell for anywhere from a few dollars to several thousand dollars. In some cases, extremely valuable Twitter handles can sell for much more than the average.

The `@x` handle is extremely valuable. It is short, unique, and has a large number of followers. According to a recent estimate, the `@x` handle could be worth as much as $100,000.

Elon Musk is the wealthiest man in the world. Surely he can afford to pay Mr. Hwang a fair price for the `@x` handle.

Elon it’s time to do the right thing. You should pay Mr. Hwang a fair price for the `@x` handle. Anything less is a slap in the face.
