The other day, I mentioned I was testing GoatCounter. This morning, I deleted my account.

It's not that GoatCounter is bad it just wasn't giving me an accurate picture of what's happening on my site. I kind of knew that going in, but being a tinkerer, I wanted to try it anyway.

What I did learn is that a lot of folks visiting my site are using ad and tracker blockers. The traffic I saw with GoatCounter was way lower than what I saw with Plausible, which I had set up to pull stats from Netlify's servers. Neither tracks RSS, so in the end, I figured why bother?

I don't need analytics to tell me whether what I write matters. If it resonates with someone, great. If not, that's okay too.
