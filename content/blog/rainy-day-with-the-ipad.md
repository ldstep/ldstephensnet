I'm always intrigued by the idea of using an iPad first. With its touch screen, keyboard, trackpad, mouse, and pencil, it’s quite compelling.

The weather has been shit for the past couple of days; a nor’easter has relentlessly dumped rain accompanied by strong winds. Since I couldn’t get outside today, I decided to use my iPad for the day to see if I could get on board with the iPad-first approach.

By the end of the day, I concluded that the iPad still falls short in many ways, even with the improvements in iPadOS 16. There’s still no proper clipboard manager, making it a hassle to move bits of text around. Managing my 11ty site? Forget it. There’s no effective way to run build scripts, preview changes, or commit updates to GitHub like I can on my Mac. I also missed my Alfred and Keyboard Maestro automations and text snippets.

Maybe next rainy day I’ll give it another try, but I’m not holding my breath—or giving up my Mac.
