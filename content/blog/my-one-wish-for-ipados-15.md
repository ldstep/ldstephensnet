[WWDC](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/03/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-is-back-in-its-all-online-format/) is just around the corner. With the [2021 iPad Pro](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-unveils-new-ipad-pro-with-m1-chip-and-stunning-liquid-retina-xdr-display/) having a M1 chip there has been a lot of speculation about what might be coming to the iPad with iPadOS 15.

I’m not a pro user so a lot of what’s being speculated is lost on me. But I do have one wish. I would like to see the Files app become a true Finder equivalent. Files needs an Open In option so that I know which app is going to open when I tap a file. And I want the ability to view a file’s extension and to be able to change it.
