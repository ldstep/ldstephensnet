I've used Firefox as my backup browser on macOS for as long as I can remember. However, it has always had some drawbacks. First, automation. Unlike Safari and Chrome, Firefox has very limited support for AppleScript and shell script. Second, it doesn't integrate with other Mac apps the way Safari and Chrome do. For example, I use Things' quick entry autofill pretty often to capture websites I want to save as to-dos. That doesn't work with Firefox. Because of these shortcomings, I've always wanted to use a Chromium-based browser, but not Chrome as my backup to Safari.

The other day, I read Mere Civilian's [post](https://merecivilian.com/my-vivaldi-setup-on-windows/) about [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) and decided to give it a try. Over the weekend, I downloaded it and spent some time customizing it to be as minimal as I could make it. Turns out, I quite like it. It may even replace Safari. It's definitely replaced Firefox.
