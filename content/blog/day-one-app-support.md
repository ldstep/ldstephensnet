I purchased the [iOS version of Day One](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-one-journal/id1044867788?mt=8&at=1000lude) journaling app about a year and a half ago thinking I would use it for journaling in place of the journal I was keeping in a [Ulysses](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225571038?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lude). My journaling is pretty hit and miss so I never got into using Day One until now.

A few months ago I decided I wanted start documenting some of the activities in my life so I started doing that in Day One. I call it a Lifelog. I do this with words and photos which is a really nice way to document things. Now I’ve decided I’m going use Day One for all my journaling. With a couple of hours work, I moved all the journal entries that I had in Ulysses into Day One.

There’s only one missing. When I purchased Day One I only purchased the iOS app which I have on my iPhone and iPad. Now I think I would like to have the [Mac app](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-one/id1055511498?mt=12&at=1000lude). Since my account is a grandfathered Plus account and not a subscription I wasn’t sure how to go about getting the Mac app.

> Plus – grandfathered
> 
> For users that purchased Day One 2.0 between February 4, 2016 and June 27, 2017:  You will see this user status in the app settings. The status is per platform. If you owned Day One only on iOS, you will have Plus on iOS only.

So I contacted support to see if there was any way to get a trial of the Mac app with Plus status.

**I have to say, this was the best support experience I’ve ever had.** My support person was Adam. He understood what I wanted to do and offered to set me up for a one week trial. I said that would be wonderful. He said at the end of the trial I could purchase the Mac app with Plus status, or go for the Premium subscription with a discount for being a previous user, or just continue using the iOS app as I have been.

**Adam was so nice and accommodating** that I feel compelled to upgrade to the Premium subscription for at least one year. He said if I don’t renew the next year my plan reverts back to the iOS Plus plan which in the end would probably be fine.
