Last September I [wrote](https://ldstephens.net/2017/09/19/on-its-last-legs/) about making a permanent move from nvALT to [Bear](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear-beautiful-writing-app/id1091189122?mt=12&at=1000lude) for notes and lists. Since then I have gone all in with Bear. The first year of my Pro subscription was up in December and I renewed it for another year without hesitation.

Now I’m experimenting with Bear as my app for writing blog posts and other short-form writing projects. This may or may not last but for now, it’s what I’m doing.

**But, there’s one thing that really bugs me.**

In markdown compatibility mode using the double asterisk syntax or ⌘B for **bold** at the beginning of a line inserts a line separator. It’s really irritating. This happens in both the iOS and macOS versions of the app. This is not a new bug. It’s been around for as long as I can remember.

I have reported this twice. It’s still not fixed. I know Shiny Frog knows about it because Shiny Frog has acknowledged my bug reports and I’ve seen complaints about it on Twitter.

Please Shiny Frog, when will this bug get fixed?
