I bought my first [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) Powerpack license on November 11, 2016, and I've used the app every day since, except for a couple of brief attempts with Raycast. Each time, I ended up going back to Alfred within a few days.

All day long, I'm triggering hotkeys, launching apps, running actions, copying stuff, jumping between files, and expanding text, all of which is done with Alfred.

I rarely check my Alfred stats, but, curious, I took a look today. Since November 5, 2022, I've used Alfred 41,762 times, an average of 44 times per day. The usage page also shows what I've used most over the past 28 days, in order:

1. General
2. Hotkeys
3. Clipboard
4. Navigation
5. Action
6. Expansion

After all these years, Alfred still earns its place on my Mac. It just works!
