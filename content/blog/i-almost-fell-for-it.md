Yesterday I almost fell for a $200 discount on the base model M4 MacBook Pro. I had convinced myself that I should get a new MacBook to replace my M1 in order to avoid a potential price increase due to the fucking tariffs.

I came across the offer from Amazon on [9to5](https://9to5mac.com/2025/04/07/m4-macbook-pro-reasons-worth-upgrading-now/). Since Iâ€™m not a fan of buying hardware from Amazon, I reached out to Best Buy, and they graciously matched the prize.

After sleeping on it overnight, I convinced myself to hold tight. Besides, I should be getting the base model Air with a 512 SSD, not the base model Pro.
