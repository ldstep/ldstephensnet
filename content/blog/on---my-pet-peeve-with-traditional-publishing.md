> Nothing in what they wrote lets you get to the OpenAI blog post they're referencing ([here it is](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2/?ref=birchtree.me), if you wanted to read it). Why? I appreciate that if they are a primary source on a story, as in they got a statement from OpenAI for them to report on, then that makes sense. But in this case they're reporting on someone else's post. **It just seems like if you're reporting on something someone else posted online, you ought to link to it.**

I have experienced this myself. Just the other day, I was reading a Verge article that quoted another article. However, the reference linked to another Verge article instead of the original source, and I wanted to read the original article. Unfortunately, there was no link to the source in the article, which I found irritating and in poor taste.
