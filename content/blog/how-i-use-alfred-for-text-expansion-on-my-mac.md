This is Part 3 of how I use [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com).

There are a number of text expansion apps available for the Mac the most popular being [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/). I considered it but the monthly subscription was a deal breaker for me. I also didn’t need anything that powerful. All I needed was basic text expansion and sync across both my Macs. After [exploring several alternatives](https://ldstephens.net/2017/02/26/choosing-a-text-expansion-app-for-mac/) I settled on using the text expansion feature that was already a part of the Alfred app.

Alfred’s text expansion feature allows me to quickly type out frequently used snippets of text, my email addresses, my name, my phone number, my address, markdown syntax, special keyboard symbols (⌘, ⌥, ⇧), the date and time, and more with a short keyword. For example, I can type **,ddate** and get the current date or I can type **,rwr** and get “Run, walk, run miles @MAF” which is a text snippet I use for logging my runs in Garmin Connect. Text expansion is all about saving time and increasing productivity.
