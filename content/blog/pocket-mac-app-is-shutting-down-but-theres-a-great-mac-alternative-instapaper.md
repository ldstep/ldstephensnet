[Mozilla shutting down Pocket app for Mac, recommends installing iOS app – 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2023/08/01/mozilla-shutting-down-pocket-app-for-mac/)

> Mozilla has announced today that its read-it-later service Pocket will be retiring its Mac app this month. Users are encouraged to install the iOS app on their Mac or use the web going forward. Here’s when and why Mozilla is shutting it down.

This is bad news for Mac users who rely on Pocket to save articles for later. But there is a great alternative: Instapaper. Instapaper is a read-it-later app that has been around for over a decade and I’ve used it since 2016.

Instapaper has a lot of great features, such as:

- **Offline reading:** You can read articles offline, even if you don’t have an internet connection.
- **Organization:** You can organize your articles into folders.
- **Customization:** You can customize the look and feel of Instapaper to your liking.
- **Syncing:** Your articles are synced across all your devices, so you can always pick up where you left off.
- **Sharing**: You can share your highlights and notes to other apps as markdown, plain text, or HTML. This is my favorite feature!

If you’re looking for a great Mac read-it-later app, I highly recommend Instapaper. It’s a great replacement for Pocket Mac, and it’s available for free.

I hope this helps!
