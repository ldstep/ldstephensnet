Facebook is always looking for new ways to violate user privacy. They’ve instituted a new one.

In the Facebook iOS mobile app, they recently added a new button under the Settings menu called “Protect”. When you click on “Protect” it takes you to an app in the App Store called “Onavo Protect – VPN Security”. **Don’t install it**.

This may seem like a good option for a free security app, but it’s not.

This is indeed a VPN. But, it routes **all** your web browsing and app usage data to a Facebook server. Think I’m kidding? I’m not. They even tell you they are.

From the [Onavo description in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onavo/id577491499)

> To provide this layer of protection, Onavo uses a VPN to establish a secure connection to direct all of your network communications through Onavo’s servers. **As part of this process, Onavo collects your mobile data traffic. This helps us improve and operate the Onavo service by analyzing your use of websites, apps and data. Because we’re part of Facebook, we also use this info to improve Facebook products and services, gain insights into the products and services people value, and build better experiences.**

This is nothing more than Facebook spyware. If you’re looking for a VPN I can recommend [TunnelBear](https://www.tunnelbear.com/). It’s what I use. It’s not free though. But remember if it’s free you’re the product.
