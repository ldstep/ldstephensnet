> For years now, I’ve been iterating on an AppleScript to copy a link for the currently selected Apple Mail message to the clipboard. You can then paste the link elsewhere and get a link back to the source message.

Slick! I set up the script in a Keyboard Maestro macro with a hotkey trigger, tested it out, and it worked perfectly. If you're interested, head over to David's [post](https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2025/12/updated-apple-mail-link-applescript/) and get the AppleScript.
