I go for a 2-mile walk with my dog Charlotte every morning. I always record my walks with my Apple Watch and listen to a podcast in Overcast. A few days ago I was walking up the driveway with my phone in my hand queueing up a podcast to listen to and while doing that Charlotte decided to lunge after a rabbit and knocked my phone out of my hand. Our driveway is gravel and the phone landed screen down. Shattered!

I love my iPhone 7 Plus but it’s getting old and I was looking forward to getting a new iPhone 12 when they’re out this fall. I initially thought about a screen repair but decided against it. Instead, I purchased and new [Product Red iPhone 11](https://www.apple.com/iphone-11/) with 64gb memory. I also got the [Apple 11 Clear Case](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVG2/iphone-11-clear-case?fnode=40d94a87d97553b0185b7c8e7fd4fdd44cffc2fdd3fe3233942402b22f9611c80d0fafa99f19c4fe6ebedaf0f9b1cd0cd79f7a9b0c19756f48d2859c570b1013904e530f3175b7447c3780fc9d3238efdcff604d78a12e96fbc5a21c06ea2928) and [Belkin InvisiGlass Ultra Screen Protector](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HNKY2ZM/A/belkin-invisiglass-ultra-screen-protection-for-iphone-11-pro-xs-x?fnode=16957b845e7becf1864009546c93bda535d18458c3ae82a5d814375566c4fe1facbf73d3d63b5c1af81181a922fa48ff1f6f7bc974fb660f4ed023c46640e9d1722439b3af54e6173d09832e2cf26f64b71a6b733d95a62cc43ee022781c70bfc814083ec77cd00b119d44ced0ef9b96&fs=f%3Dscreenprotect%26fh%3D458b%252B463b). I’m happy with my purchase but was really hoping to hold out for the iPhone 12. I’ll get over it.

I like most everything about the iPhone 11. Face ID is wonderful and swipe in place of a Home button is the coolest. The keyboard on the 11 is a bit smaller than I’m used to on the 7 Plus but I wasn’t going to spend another $300 to get the iPhone 11 Pro ($699 vs $999) to have a minimally bigger keyboard.
