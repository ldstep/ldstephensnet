Since installing iOS 11 I keep getting in-app popups asking for a rating. I find this annoying. If I want to rate an app I can go to the App Store to rate it. I don’t need a popup pestering me.

Here’s how I turned off in-app rating requests. Go to **Settings > iTunes & App Store > In-App Ratings & Reviews** and turn it off.

By the way, while I was there I also turned off **Video Autoplay**.
