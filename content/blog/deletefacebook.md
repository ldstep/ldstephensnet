Since the [Cambridge Analytica news broke](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html) “deletefacebook” is trending. It appears users are leaving the social network in big numbers. They have figured out that Facebook is nothing more than a mass surveillance machine. Their service is not to make life better, as they would have you believe, but instead to gather as much information about you as they can and then sell it for **targeted ads and services**. That’s their core business model of collect, store, analyze, and exploit.

I found [John Biggs TechCrunch article #deletefacebook](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/deletefacebook/) worth sharing. It’s about his realization that Facebook’s having so much of his personal information is a liability.

> Facebook is using us. It is actively giving away our information. It is creating an echo chamber in the name of connection. It surfaces the divisive and destroys the real reason we began using social media in the first place – human connection.

> It is a cancer.

> I’ve begun the slow process of weaning myself off of the platform by methodically running a script that will delete my old content.

I encourage you my reader to #deletefacebook. I would but I’ve never had an account so I have nothing to delete.
