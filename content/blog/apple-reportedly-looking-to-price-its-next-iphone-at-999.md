Price scoop, for the soon to he announced new iPhone, from Brian Chen of the New York times. Mixed in the middle of his article [“Dear iPhone: Here’s Why We’re Still Together After 10 Years”](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/23/technology/personaltech/iphone-10-years.html?nytmobile=0) is the starting price for the new iPhone.

​Brian X. Chen, [writing for the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/23/technology/personaltech/iphone-10-years.html?nytmobile=0)

> Chief among the changes for the new iPhones: refreshed versions, including a premium model priced at around $999, according to people briefed on the product, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Apple made room for a bigger screen on that model by reducing the size of the bezel — or the forehead and the chin — on the face of the device. Other new features include facial recognition for unlocking the device, along with the ability to charge it with magnetic induction, the people said.

If this is true, the new iPhone carries a hefty price tag. This could be a breaking point for some folks. I think I’ll probably be sticking with my iPhone 7 Plus.
