I’m honored to have been featured in the 103rd edition of Manu Moreale’s People and Blogs series. Manu has been running this project for a while now, inviting folks from around the web to share a bit about themselves and their blogs. It was a fun experience, and I’m happy to share my turn here.

*The following was originally posted as the [103rd edition](https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-loren-stephens) of Manu's People and Blogs series.*

## Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?

I'm Loren Stephens, and I recently turned 80. I'm originally from California, but now I live in central New Jersey with my partner, Lisa, our dog, Trix, and a flock of chickens (yes, they all have names) on our 10-acre property. We also have an abundance of wildlife roaming through.

I retired in 2009, so it's been a while since I've had to get up and go to work every day. Before retiring, I spent 25 years in the automotive industry, 12 years in finance, and 8 years in advertising and media.

These days, I spend my time with Lisa and our animals, looking after our land (which is certified by New Jersey as a wildlife habitat). My routine is pretty consistent, I get my daily exercise, tinker with tech like Jack Baty, read a lot, and handle whatever needs doing around the property. Probably sounds boring, but it works for me.

## What's the story behind your blog?

I've had several blogs over the years. The first one I remember was on Blogger, sometime after Google bought it in 2003. Honestly, I have no idea what I was writing about back then.

ldstephens.net started on WordPress.com in 2016, around the time I was switching from PC and Android to Apple. I was excited to learn how to use my new iPhone and Mac--and to figure out what apps I should be using. That's when I discovered [Mac Power Users](https://www.relay.fm/mpu). I listened to every episode from the start, and I'm still listening today.

I was learning so much that I wanted to share what I found. I started blogging in the hope that someone else might stumble across my posts and discover something helpful or interesting about using Apple gear. That's still a lot of what I write about today. But I also write for myself to think through ideas and document what I'm learning.

Last year, I started experimenting with the static site generator [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and found a WordPress importer. I migrated my blog, and now it's built with 11ty and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?

It's pretty straightforward. I write all my posts in Markdown with front matter, using Drafts on my Mac. Once the post feels ready, I save it to my Desktop and name the file with the post slug.

From there, I drag the file into a [Dropzone](https://www.dropzone.dev/) action that moves it into the right folder in my local 11ty project. If needed, I'll open the project in VS Code to make any final edits. Then I use GitHub Desktop to commit and push the changes. Netlify takes care of publishing the site.

I like to keep the whole process simple and flexible.

## Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?

Not really. Being retired, I write when I feel like it, with no schedule, and because I enjoy it. I usually write on my Mac, sitting somewhere quiet in the house. I try to keep things simple and low pressure.

## A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?

My blog is a static site built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), using [HTML and CSS](https://htmlforpeople.com/), and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It automatically deploys whenever I push changes to the [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/ldstep/ldstephensnet).

For writing posts, tweaking the design, or adding features, I work in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I draft posts in Markdown using [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/), then add them to the site in VS Code. I do it all on my M4 MacBook Pro.

## Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?

Yes. If I were starting a blog today, knowing what I know now, I'd use a static site generator from the start. I've learned enough HTML and CSS to build and maintain a simple static site, and I like the control it gives me.

For someone who doesn't have the time or interest to mess with static site generators, I'd suggest starting with something simple like [Pika](https://pika.page/) or maybe [Bear](https://bearblog.dev/) if you want a little more flexibility. I'd recommend staying away from WordPress, it's too much overhead for a personal blog.

## Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?

My blog is free to run. 11ty, GitHub, and Netlify are all free to use, and I don’t track analytics. The only cost is $20 a year for the domain. As for making money from it, I’m not interested. It’s free and always will be for anyone to read.

I’m fine with donation buttons like Ko-Fi or Buy Me a Coffee on other people’s blogs. But if an indie blogger starts putting some or all of their content behind a paywall, I’m done. The real question is whether the income from these efforts actually makes a difference financially. I bet in 99.9% of cases, it doesn’t. By switching to a paywalled model, they probably annoy a lot of their loyal readers. So why bother?

## Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?

Here are a few indie bloggers I enjoy reading, and I don't think they've been interviewed on People and Blogs yet:

 * [Jack Baty](https://baty.net/)
 * [Blake Watson](https://blakewatson.com/)
 * [Dave Rogers](https://nice-marmot.net/rss.xml)
 * [Chris Hannah](https://chrishannah.me/)
 * [Thomas Rigby](https://thomasrigby.com/)
 * [MacOS Guru](http://bicycleforyourmind.com/)

## Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?

I don’t have much going on in the way of side projects right now; the blog is my main creative outlet. I still enjoy listening to Mac Power Users, which got me started down this path, and I keep up with a few other Apple-focused podcasts and indie blogs through RSS.

When it comes to websites I enjoy, I like simple personal blogs where people write about what interests them. I appreciate clean, distraction-free sites with thoughtful writing.

I just enjoy learning new things and writing about them.

PS: I don’t do social media, so the only place you’ll find me is on my [blog](https://ldstephens.net/).
