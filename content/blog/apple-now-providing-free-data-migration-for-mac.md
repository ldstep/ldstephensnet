Apple is now offering data migration services for free when you purchase a new Mac or need to have a Mac replaced or repaired. Until now data migration was $99.

[Tidbits](https://tidbits.com/2019/04/09/apple-drops-99-data-migration-fee-for-new-macs-and-repairs/) heard about the policy change from a reader and confirmed the change with an Apple Store Operations Specialist.

> Beginning April 2, there will be no cost for Data Migrations with the purchase of a new Mac or Data Transfers with a repair.
