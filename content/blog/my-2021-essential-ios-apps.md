Every year towards the end of December I evaluate the apps that I’ve been using and what I will use for the next year. I find that writing this out helps me better evaluate the apps that best fit my workflows. Once I complete my evaluation, I summarize it in a post on this blog.

Another reason for this post is that visitors are always asking me which apps I use for specific tasks. To keep from repeating myself over and over, here’s the list of apps that I use.

## My setup:

-   MacBook Pro early–2015 13” (soon to be replaced with a MacBook Air M1/8gb)
-   iPhone 11
-   iPad 5th Generation (which I rarely use these days)
-   Apple Watch 44 mm Series 4

#### Web

Safari – Safari is my browser of choice. I use [Wipr](https://giorgiocalderolla.com/wipr.html) with Safari to block ads, trackers, cryptocurrency miners, and other annoyances.

#### Communication

[Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=14726057) – I’ve been using Fastmail for email ever since [I left Gmail](https://ldstephens.medium.com/two-years-of-fastmail-and-how-it-replaced-gma-840d38bc17b) over 6 years. I also use it for calendar, and contacts.

Fastmail has an [iOS app](https://www.fastmail.com/help/clients/mobileapp.html), that I use.

[Messages](https://support.apple.com/explore/messages) – Messages is how I communicate with family and friends.

#### Calendar and Tasks

[Fantastical 3](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) – Fantastical is my calendar and task app. It integrates perfectly with my Fastmail calendar appointments and events and Apple [Reminders](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reminders/id1108187841) tasks.

[Due](https://www.dueapp.com/) – Due is where I keep all my reminders. What I love about Due is that it repeatedly notifies you of overdue reminders until I mark them complete or reschedule them.

#### Reading

[Reeder](https://www.reederapp.com/) – Reeder is what I use for my [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/welcome) RSS feeds. Anything that I want to read I save to [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) for reading later.

[Twitter](https://twitter.com) – Twitter is for news and the feeds for apps that I use.

#### Writing

[Drafts 5](https://getdrafts.com/) – I’ve been using Drafts for several years. Drafts is a launching-off point for text – use the actions to copy it, share it, or deep link into other apps and services.

[1Writer](https://1writerapp.com/) – I don’t write on iOS but I do some proofreading and editing and for that I use 1Writer.

[Apple Notes](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notes/id1110145109) – Notes that I want to keep long-term go in the Notes app.

[Day One Journal](https://dayoneapp.com/) – I keep a lifelog in Day One.

#### Utilities / Productivity

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) – Gotta have a password manager.

[Scanner Pro](https://readdle.com/scannerpro) – Scanner Pro is also part of my paperless workflow. I use it to scan paper documents into PDFs with OCR that look clean and professional.

[TunnelBear VPN](https://www.tunnelbear.com) – TunnelBear is my VPN for security on public WiFi and web browsing privacy.

[PCalc](https://pcalc.com/) – PCalc is my stock calculator replacement. I use it for its additional features and customization.

#### Health and Fitness

[Apple Fitness](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/activity/id1208224953#?platform=iphone) – I use the Workout and Fitness apps with my Apple Watch to track my daily activities.

To keep my mind occupied during workouts I listen to podcasts in [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/).
