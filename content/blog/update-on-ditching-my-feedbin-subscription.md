A while back, I [mentioned](https://ldstephens.net/blog/ditching-my-feedbin-subscription/) ditching my Feedbin subscription.

> My Feedbin renewal is coming up in a couple of months, and I’ve made up my mind I’m not renewing. So today, I updated my feeds in NetNewsWire and started using it full-time. That way, by the time my Feedbin subscription expires, I’ll be comfortable with the switch.

Here’s an update.

iCloud sync is a total pain in the ass. It’s especially bad in Reeder Classic. NetNewsWire handles it a bit better, but I just can’t keep using it. It’s a fantastic free app, and I’d definitely recommend it to others, but it’s not for me.

So, I’ve decided to change my mind, I’ll keep my Feedbin subscription and stick with Reeder.
