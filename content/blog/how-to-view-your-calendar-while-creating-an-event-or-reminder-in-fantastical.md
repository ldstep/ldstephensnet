I’ve been using [Fantastical](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2-for-iphone-calendar/id718043190?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lude) for a long time. Occasionally when creating a new event or reminder I need to reference my calendar. This involved saving the event or reminder > checking my calendar > getting the info I needed > and then reopening the event or reminder.

I often wondered if there might be an easier way to do this and there is.

I ran across [this trick](http://thesweetsetup.com/view-calendar-creating-event-fantastical/#) the other day while scanning through [The Sweet Setup Quick Tip archive](http://thesweetsetup.com/category/quick-tip/). Here’s how you do it. When you are in the new event or reminder window, tap and drag down the title in the red bar. This will minimize it to the bottom of the screen. To get back to the event, tap on the event window in the bottom center. You can actually have multiple event drafts at the same time. Double tapping the minimized events will launch them in a window where you can tap on the one you want to work with.
