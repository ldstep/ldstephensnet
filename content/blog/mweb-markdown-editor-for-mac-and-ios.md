I came across MWeb from a Medium reader comment suggesting it as a [Ulysses](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225570693?mt=12&uo=4&at=1000lude) replacement. Not being familiar with the app I checked in with the king of markdown text editors [macosxguru](https://twitter.com/macosxguru). I figured he would know about it and sure enough, he did.

He has been kind enough to do a nice review of the Mac app.

> 
> MWeb is a surprise. It is a deep product which improves on both Ulysses and Bear in some areas and brings some unique skills to the Markdown editor genre.
> 
> It is the usual three-pane Markdown based text editor. Similar to LightPaper, TextNut – A CommonMark editor for Mac, Bear – Notes for iPhone, iPad and Mac or Ulysses to name a few. This category is a competitive category in the macOS marketplace.
