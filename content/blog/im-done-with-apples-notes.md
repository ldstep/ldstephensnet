I have never liked Apple Notes because I have found it to be unreliable in several ways. But a few months ago I thought I would give it a try because I kept reading and hearing good things about it. So I copied all my notes from [Bear](https://bear.app/) to Apple Notes. After doing so everything was running along smoothly. As a fall back I kept my notes up in Bear and I’m glad I did.

So, here we are with iOS 13 and iPadOS and Notes is having sync issues. After reading a few support forums I found this to be a common problem among Apple Notes users. Notes fail to sync, or at best, some notes randomly sync hours later. I don’t have the patience for this.

I’m back to Bear for notes and short-form writing. I have over 500 notes and never had a sync issue. Another great thing about Bear is that I can [backup my notes](https://bear.app/faq/Backup%20&%20Restore/) just in case. I also missed the ability to [export a note](https://bear.app/faq/Import%20&%20export/Export%20your%20notes/) if I wanted to.

Goodbye Apple Notes never again.
