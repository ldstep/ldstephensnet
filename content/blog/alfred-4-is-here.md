My Mac [launcher app](https://www.alfredapp.com/) has gotten an [update.](https://www.alfredapp.com/whats-new/)

Although I didn’t see much reason to upgrade from version 3 I did so anyway. I want to support the developer so I also upgraded my Powerpack license.

Alfred is an indispensable part of the daily use of my Macs. I use it at least 20 to 30 times every day. You can find all the articles that I’ve written about Alfred [here](https://ldstephens.net/category/alfred/).
