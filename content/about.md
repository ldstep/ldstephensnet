# About

Hey there! I’m ldstephens, and welcome to my little corner of the internet.

Since 2016, I’ve been writing about how I use Apple gadgets and apps, and sharing tech tips that make my digital life easier. I also share my personal experiences, thoughts, and reflections here.

This blog is a static site built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), using [HTML and CSS](https://htmlforpeople.com/), and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It automatically deploys whenever I commit changes to the [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/ldstep/ldstephensnet).

When adding new posts, changing the design, or adding new features, that is done in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

New posts are written in Markdown in [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) and added to a new post in VS Code.
