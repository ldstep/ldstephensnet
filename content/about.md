# About

Hey, I’m ldstephens. I’ve been writing online since the late 1990s, and I can’t count how many times I’ve pulled the plug on previous blogs. For now, this is my little corner of the web where I share whatever’s on my mind: stories, random thoughts, tech stuff I'm tinkering with, and the occasional rant. You’ll also find quotes that resonate with me and links I believe are worth sharing.

Anyway, like I said, this is my little corner of the web. Could be great, could be a mess. Either way, stick around. Or don’t. It’s your call.

I was recently featured on Manu Moreale's [People and Blogs](https://manuelmoreale.com/interview/loren-stephens) if you're interested in learning more about me.

**Colophon**

This is a static site built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), using [HTML and CSS](https://htmlforpeople.com/), and deployed on [Vercel](https://www.netlify.com). It automatically deploys whenever I commit changes to the [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/ldstep/ldstephensnet).

When adding new posts, changing the design, or adding new features, that is done in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

New posts are written in Markdown in [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) and added to a new post in VS Code.

Thanks for visiting!
