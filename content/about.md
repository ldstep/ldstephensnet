# About

Hey there! I'm ldstephens, and welcome to my little corner of the internet. Since 2016, I've been writing here about Apple gadgets, apps, tips, and how I use my devices day to day. You'll also find stories, random thoughts, the occasional rant, quotes that stick with me, and links that I find worth sharing.

I recently got featured on Manu Moreale’s [People and Blogs](https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-loren-stephens) if you’re interested in learning more about me.

**Colophon**

This is a static site built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), using [HTML and CSS](https://htmlforpeople.com/), and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It automatically deploys whenever I commit changes to the [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/ldstep/ldstephensnet).

When adding new posts, changing the design, or adding new features, that is done in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

New posts are written in Markdown in [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) and added to a new post in VS Code.

Thanks for visiting!
