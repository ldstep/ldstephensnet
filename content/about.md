# About

Hey there! I'm ldstephens. I love experimenting with technology, tinkering with ideas, and writing about my discoveries. There's something satisfying about figuring something out and sharing it with others who might be facing the same challenges.

My focus here has always been practical: I aim to create posts that others can benefit from, particularly in the technology space. If I've spent hours solving a technical challenge, why not document it so someone else can save that time?

You'll also find the occasional rant, quotes that resonate with me, and links that I find worth sharing.

At the end of the day, this site is my little corner of the web where I share what I learn, hoping to make someone else's path a bit easier.

I was recently featured on Manu Moreale's [People and Blogs](https://manuelmoreale.com/interview/loren-stephens) if you're interested in learning more about me.

**Colophon**

This is a static site built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), using [HTML and CSS](https://htmlforpeople.com/), and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It automatically deploys whenever I commit changes to the [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/ldstep/ldstephensnet).

When adding new posts, changing the design, or adding new features, that is done in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

New posts are written in Markdown in [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) and added to a new post in Sublime Text.

Thanks for visiting!
