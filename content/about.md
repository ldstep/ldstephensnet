# About

Hey there! I'm ldstephens, and welcome to my little corner of the internet. I've been writing here since 2016 about Apple gadgets, apps, tips, and tricks, as well as how I use my devices on a day-to-day basis. This is where I also share my thoughts and opinions on life, technology, current events, the occasional rant, blogging, and other topics that come to mind.

I recently got featured on Manu Moreale’s [People and Blogs](https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-loren-stephens) if you’re interested in learning more about me.

**Colophon**

This is a static site built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), using [HTML and CSS](https://htmlforpeople.com/), and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It automatically deploys whenever I commit changes to the [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/ldstep/ldstephensnet).

When adding new posts, changing the design, or adding new features, that is done in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

New posts are written in Markdown in [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) and added to a new post in VS Code.

Thanks for visiting!
