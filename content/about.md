# About

Hi, I'm ldstephens. Welcome! I've been writing here since 2016 about Apple gadgets, apps, tips, tricks, and how I use my devices day to day.

I also write beyond tech, personal stories, random thoughts, and the occasional rant. Since not everyone who visits this site wants that mix, I post those pieces separately on my [Weblog](https://weblog.ldstephens.net).

**Colophon**

This is a static site built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), using [HTML and CSS](https://htmlforpeople.com/), and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It automatically deploys whenever I commit changes to the [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/ldstep/ldstephensnet).

When adding new posts, changing the design, or adding new features, that is done in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

New posts are written in Markdown in [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) and added to a new post in VS Code.

Thanks for visiting!
